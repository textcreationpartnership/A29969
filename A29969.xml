            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE To the READER.</head>
            <head type="sub">Who is a Lover of Truth.</head>
            <p>IT is a known Maxim amongſt the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and men of Sence, that we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that which ſeems moſt probable, till we find an opportunity of coming better and more eaſily to the Truth. But this is alſo on the other ſide a fundamental Truth among the intelligent, that when any one has found a clearer and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way of drawing nearer to Truth, that he muſt forſake his former, and embrace the latter way. Yea and more then that, the Duty of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous man requires that he never ſtand ſtill, or lye down at reſt upon his knowledge, but that he be inceſſantly ſearching ſtill after Truth that he may more and more draw nigh unto it, and therefore our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Matth. 7.7. Seek and ye ſhall find.</hi> Even our own Nature teacheth us, that when we are not continually
<pb facs="tcp:48714:3"/>ſeeking, but reſting upon that which we have once learned, we go backward even in that which we know; For ſeeing man is continually change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in all things, and can never ſtand ſtill, as to his underſtanding, he muſt be going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or he will go backwards. If then he does not increaſe in knowledge, his knowledge will decreaſe, &amp; he will be as one in a ſleep, ſo that he will not have that ſagacity of underſtanding, that he formerly had. Verily nothing can be more evident to a man than this: For he that thinks that he knows any thing perfectly, and ſo will ſeek no further, he ſhall find in proceſs of time, either that what he knew before, ſhall not be ſo clear to him as formerly, yea that he ſhall even have forgot in whole, or in part, or elſe, that if he oft rehearſes that which he has learned as a Leſſon, will no longer be as a Truth to him: but only a remembrance of that which once he knew as a Truth: For when any one finds a Truth, he cannot but be glad and rejoice at it, yea and as oft as that Truth preſents it ſelf to him as truth, and not barely as ſomething that he calls to mind, ſo that he thereby learns other Truths, he will be ſo touched and affected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with in his Inward-man, that the joy that he has by reaſon of it, ſhall be of more eſteem with him than all Earthly Treaſures: But if he eſteems what he has learned for truth, ſo as to conceit himſelf to know all things that are knowable, and ſo ſeeks no further, he ſhall be
<pb facs="tcp:48714:3"/>ſenſible of no more joy and gladneſs in him, by reaſon thereof, but will through a conſtant cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, declare it to others, while he is not at all affected with it himſelf in his inward-man, for the outward geſtures are attained by cuſtom to keep themſelves in the Reputation and good opinion of the People.</p>
            <p>If then it be the duty of an honeſt man, and a lover of the Truth, never to ſtand ſtill and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon his knowledge, but conſtantly to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward more and more in the ſame, yea not only to keep on in his old way, but if he has found a better, to quit his former way, then will no man, I hope be ſo unreaſonable as to blame that in me which is praiſe-worthy in others, <hi>viz.</hi> That having once found a better way to attain unto the Truth, that I do quit my former thoughts both in <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> which then did ſeem probable unto me. Yea, I can truely ſay, that nothing is more dear to me, than ſo to know the truth, that all things may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under one and the ſame truth, and not that divers things have divers Principles, from whence they are derived. And therefore, he that can give me occaſion to find the Truth, and that ſo that it every way, and in all its parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with it ſelf, or ſo hangs together that one part doth not contradict the other, him I will follow, and forſake my wrong Opinions; Nor is this to be called Levity or Changeableneſs; but any one that has a conſcience, muſt needs be
<pb facs="tcp:48714:4"/>convinced, that I ſeek after truth if perhaps I may find it.</p>
            <p>I know full well, that this is not to ſpeak af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the mode of the times, for he is counted a brave man that has a good memory, and can talk juſt as his Maſter has taught him, and that looks upon it as a piece of Sanctity not to depart one Tittle from it: yea the corruption of Manners is ſuch, that men look at nothing but Money, Honour, Maſterſhip, and to diſpiſe one another, to make themſelves great, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to be ſhort, I will communicate unto the ſober Reader, ſome of my Remarks, that he may thence ſee what has moved me by all manner of ways to purſure the Truth.</p>
            <p>There's nothing more common nor more No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious in theſe days, than to diſtinguiſh between <hi>Theology</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and to affirm the one to be built upon quite other Grounds than the other; This way of Talk always ſeemed ſtrange to me, and ſo much the more, becauſe upon my enquiry into the Original both of <hi>Theology</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> I found them both to flow from one and the ſame Spring, to wit, from the <hi>Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> whence I learned, that God being the Author both of his Holy Word and of Reaſon, and all Natural things, theſe two, <hi>Gods Word,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> could neither contradict each other, nor be ſeparated from one another, and conſequently, that either the modern <hi>Theology,</hi> or <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> was falſe, or both of them were wrong.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:48714:4"/>
            <p>And when I came to conſider the Common <hi>Theology,</hi> I found it divided into very many Sects, and that each Sect thought not only his opinion to be the beſt, but that the want of Charity was ſo great, that each Sect judged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and vomited forth Curſes againſt the other. And in ſhort, that Sect no which the Civil Magiſtrate ſtands affected, is there ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to have the Truth and oppreſſeth the other, ſo that he that has the longeſt Sword among them, has not only the greateſt right on his ſide, but has moſt Truth, and therefore the Weapons of (this kind of) Religion are no longer powerful through God, but Carnal.</p>
            <p>But it is not only thus, as to Divinity, and the Sects one to another in General; But good God! what ſelf-Love, ambition and Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip over one another do not thoſe of the ſame Sect ſeek after? They uſe fraudulent Tricks, alledge falſe Citations out of other mens Books, to render them ſuſpected: And if any man does but a little depart from the Eccleſiaſtick Laws of the Sect in which he is, he muſt forſooth be Excommunicated, he has once ſigned them, and therefore muſt blindly follow them, tho' made only by men, and altho' he finds it otherwiſe in the <hi>Holy Scriptures:</hi> Theſe and diverſe other things are ſufficient Proofs, that thoſe times are not yet fulfilled of which <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaks <hi>Chapter 31. V. 33.34. I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48714:5"/>
               <hi>it in their Hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my People: And they ſhall teach no more every man his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and every man his Brother, ſaying, know the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But when we ſhall once arrive at thoſe bleſſed days, then ſhall that cumber of Councils, Synods, and Aſſemblies be at an end, and vaniſh, and Chriſt alone ſhall Rule by his Spirit: and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it over Chriſts flock, and force upon. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſuch like Traſh ſhall no more be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned among us; but on the Contrary, Love ſhall increaſe, and ſpiritual things be familiar, and commonly known unto us.</p>
            <p>Now as to the Mondern <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> I have experienced it to be only converſant about things viſible and palpable to teach nothing at all of that which is eſſential, or of the Nature and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of things. For when at any time we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to reduce it to uſe, thereby to diſſect and know natural things and to attain the knowledge of Man and his Diſeaſes (for Medicine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and the knowledge of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> if true, includes the knowledge of Medicine) I always found it void of Truth, and that it could not give me the knowledge of Diſtempers, nor the Cauſes of them: which Experience made me ſee that the Modern corpuſcular Philoſophy is nothing elſe but a heap of Words.</p>
            <p>I leave in the mean while others to think and ſpeak what they pleaſe, to the contrary, but of this
<pb facs="tcp:48714:5"/>I am aſſured, that it neither does nor can give any man Wiſdom, either in things Divine or Natural: But makes man ſo altogether Corporeal, that he knows nothing of the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; and I would fain ſee any man that thinks otherwiſe of it, to give ſome evidence to the contrary, and to ſhew how it is poſſible, that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhould operate without their Life or Spirit, and how they can every way be applyed to man and his Operations, and ſo long as no man does this, (as it is impoſſible upon their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to do it) I deem them ignorant of thoſe Principles that give occaſion for the explaining and underſtanding of things both Divine and Natural from one and the ſame ground.</p>
            <p>Theſe above mentioned difficulties cauſed me then to look about, for otherways, and to enquire if there were no mediums to be found, that might give occaſion to diſcover the conſonancy betwixt things Divine and Natural: Along time had I enquired with uncertainty enough after it, yea, ſo far I was come as to eſteem all things in <hi>Philoſophy</hi> uncertain: But then I found the Truth of that ſaying, that when we are at the greatest loſs in our ſelves, then the means of our Deliverance are neareſt at hand; when I began to be acquainted, and to have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Converſation with the <hi>Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the Baron F. M. Van Helmont, &amp;c.</hi> a Gentleman whoſe worth I am not capable of deſcribing, and to whom it would be a leſſening
<pb facs="tcp:48714:6"/>(for me ſo very far below his Honourable ſtate and Dignity) to attempt to ſound forth his praiſe, the <hi>Emperour</hi> and <hi>Roman Empire</hi> having done it already, not by Word of Mouth, but by Writing: Only this I ſhall ſay, that he has been to me an Example, not only in Doctrine but alſo in life, and whoſe actions I have found to agree with his Words, a thing that in theſe times can with truth be ſaid of few.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman then brought often forth things both in <hi>Theology</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> which I had never before heard, yea, which ſeem'd very ſtrange unto me, and that ſo much the more, becauſe I heard it by piece meals, now one piece, and then another, which I knew not how to joyn together. But as all knowledge and Wiſdom in its first beginning ſeems difficult, and wonderful, becauſe we have been prepoſſeſt with other Principles: Therfore I began to think whether the cauſe of my blindneſſ, and inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to underſtand, proceeded not rather from the prejudices I had ſuckt in, than from what his Honour ſaid. And ſo reſolving with my ſelf neither to approve nor contradict his ſentiments, but to examine them, whether there were no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in them, or whether they could all be derived from one Principle. Wherefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to note ſome things upon Paper, it is true and I muſt confeſs it, that the things ſeemed mighty intricate and troubleſome to me to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend at the firſt, but when I found but any
<pb facs="tcp:48714:6"/>thing that gave me any occaſion to underſtand things, I ſtuck at no pains, ſo that it did not diſcourage, nor was it tedious to me at all, to imploy a whole Years time, to comprehend the thoughts of this Gentleman, upon Man and his Diſeaſes, and ſo deduce them to Writing that one thing neceſſarily follow'd upon the other.</p>
            <p>While I had then this entercours with his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour concerning natural things, it oft times hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that Scriptural Truths, and Theologick did occur, which were altogether as ſtrange to me, and quite out of the common Road, as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophick.</p>
            <p>But becauſe I have now found that his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours Thoughts both in <hi>Theology</hi> and <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy</hi> do hang very well together, and are Truth, I judge it no leſs my duty, the rather becauſe <hi>Theology</hi> is a thing that concerns every one, and in which no man ought to rely upon the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of another, but every one ought to be a Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue for himſelf, and to ſearch after Divine Wiſdom, I ſay I therefore judged it no leſs my Duty to examine whether his Honours thoughts in <hi>Theology,</hi> could be derived from the ſame Principle of <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> whereunto I found no readier way, than firſt, to lay aſide all Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and in the fear of God to examine what manner of Being and Operation the Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and its Operation muſt needs be, if we will ſo unite the Attributes of God, ſo that the one does not run counter to the other, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:48714:7"/>ſhould follow upon the one Attribute, which would contradict the other, and this Harmony I found in his thoughts, and I thank God that opened my Eyes to ſee it. And I muſt confeſſs, that I then found that this Gentlemans thoughts did not contradict the Attributes of God ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but were a Conſequent thereof; For which reaſon I follow Divinity by this thred, to ſee what truth will thereby be diſcovered: This I can at preſent ſay, at leaſt, that I have now found the Great Wiſdom of the Creator about the firſt Man; Yea I have with full aſſurance learned what it is that reconciles the ſinner to God again, who muſt needs be that Reconciler, and on what ways the ſinner obtains Communion and Fellowship with that Reconciler: I now affirm, Knowing and being aſſured by the Grace of God, that <hi>Theology</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy</hi> is one and the ſame thing: But what? Verily not that which ſtands in the many fictions, inventions, and Speculations of empty heads, or in much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, but which is given unto man by the ſame Spirit, that enlightens his Eyes to Learn Divine things: And this I have found to be Truth what is ſaid <hi>1 Cor. 12. That it is one and the ſame Spirit which imparts unto man the Gift of Healing, Faith, and many Tongues,</hi> &amp;c. Let the world exclaim againſt me as they will, render me as odious as they can, and call me all to naught as they pleaſe, I will cleave to the Holy Scripture alone, without the Gloſſes
<pb facs="tcp:48714:7"/>of men, or their Commentaries, therein lyes both the true <hi>Theology</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> and therefore O Truth-loving Reader! Seek thou the Truth in Gods Word alone, come by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to find and know what the Operation of the Spirits is, and then thou wilt not poſſibly doubt of the Truth of it.</p>
            <p>This one thing only I ſhall here add, that if it pleaſe God to afford me health, I ſhall hereafter Treat of <hi>The Fall of Man,</hi> and how he muſt be reſtored.</p>
            <p>Farewell Reader, and read with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that thou mayſt reap profit thereby.</p>

            <head>OF THE <hi>Divine Being</hi> And its ATTRIBUTES.</head>
            <p n="1">§. 1. HE that has at any time Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Divine Being, how it is, and how many Perfections or Properties it does poſſeſs, muſt needs confeſs that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to comprehend the Being of God with all the Attributes thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being but a Creature, he muſt needs have infinitely leſs Knowledge and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than the Creator, becauſe he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not the Work of Creation, nor has the leaſt Power to Suſtain his own Being, much leſs to Ceate other things, without himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. For if it were poſſible for any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to comprehend God and all his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, that Creature muſt needs have many more Perfections, than the Creator, becauſe what comprehends another thing, is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48714:9"/>then that which it comprehends; and therefore, if any Creature could in its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding comprehend God, that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would have a larger underſtanding than God himſelf, which is impoſſible; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that which Creates a thing, is more perfect than the thing it Creates, which would be as if one ſaid, that a part is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the whole, and a Point greater than the Circumference, which includes it.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. But tho' no Creature comprehends all the properties of the Divine Being, yet hence follows not, that we do not know, or cannot know that God is; for that many, yea all things, that we meet with, we do know by their Operations, do exiſt, tho' we know them not with all their properties; and therefore, tho' no man can comprehend God with all his perfections, yet he can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that there is, and muſt needs be a Being, that Created him, if he does but examine himſelf, and compare his Creature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Power with the Power of the Creator.</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. It is moſt certain, and beyond all Contradiction, that he, that will try his own Forces, and Examine what is in his own power, ſhall find, that he cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the leaſt thing out of another thing, unleſs it be included in it. Yea he ſhall find, that he cannot keep his own Body in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48714:9"/>that State, that he deſires it ſhould remain in, but that it ſhall, whether he will or no, dye, and return to Duſt, Worms and ſuch like.</p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. This Impotency teaches him, not only that he cannot preſerve his Body in the ſame ſtate, <hi>but alſo that it muſt needs have been formed in time, and has not been for ever;</hi> For that where there is a perpetual dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there cannot be any limitation of time, and therefore it is altogether impoſſible, that that, which had no beginning, can have an end, or ceaſe to continue in that ſtate, or frame in which it has always been.</p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. Whence then follows, that Man ſeeing his deficiency, and being conſcious thereof, muſt needs acknowledge, that he cannot have been produced by a Being that is unable to ſuſtain it ſelf, becauſe then it would be much leſs able to give Being to any thing without its ſelf; <hi>But that he was made by a Being, that is ſuſtained by no other,</hi> becauſe this would imply the very ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, to wit, that it would be unable to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain others, if it wanted power to ſuſtain it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="7">§. 7. And for as much as the Creator muſt needs have that Perfection, that he does ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf, it neceſſarily follows, <hi>that the Creator himſelf was not Created, but has always
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48714:10"/>been:</hi> Becauſe that he that ſuſtains himſelf at preſent, muſt either have been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produced by ſome other, and by him have been ſuſtained till this preſent time, and have now received that Power not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſuſtaining himſelf, but others alſo; or he muſt always have had that Power of ſuſtaining himſelf and others, as well as he has it at this preſent.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, It is moſt certain, that to ſay, that the Creature can have been at firſt created by ſome other, and have obtained the Power of ſuſtaining not only himſelf, but others; is nothing elſe, but a parcel of words, which being well examined, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes a contradiction. For whoever is Created by another, muſt neceſſarily be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant of him that created him; becauſe nothing can ſubſiſt out of, or without its Principle or Origine: For that every Effect ceaſes, when that Cauſe that ſuſtains it in its ſtate, ceaſes: To ſay then, that tho' the Creator were created by another, yet he might himſelf have received the Faculty not only of ſuſtaining himſelf, but alſo of Creating others, would be juſt as if one ſhould ſay, that a Building can keep ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without its Foundation.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if we ſhould admit this Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that a Creature could poſſeſs the Power of upholding it ſelf, and Creating others,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48714:10"/>he muſt have received this Power <hi>either at his Creation from the very firſt beginning, or ſome time after, or he muſt have acquired it of himſelf:</hi> For a fourth is unconceivable. If he ſhould have received it together with his firſt Exiſtence from him that Created him, then he cannot be conſidered as a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; but only as a means, or medium, by which the Creator did exerciſe his Power, becauſe he has not this Power of himſelf, but receives it, from another: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis a miſtake to ſay, that he has recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Power of upholding himſelf, and Creating others, and an abuſe of words; for that it can ſignifie nothing elſe, but that God created him and daily upholds him: And ſo the ſecond poſition falls, <hi>viz.</hi> that he ſhould have received this Power ſome time after. As to the third, it would be conſidered, whether it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that any thing can give it ſelf more power, than it has received; or to ſpeak yet plainer, than its Nature and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties do imply. Verily this is ſo abſurd and impoſſible, that it cannot be conceived by any Man of common ſence: Becauſe Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Experience teaches us the contrary.</p>
            <p>It follows then, that no Creature can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the faculty of Upholding it ſelf, or of giving Being to other things.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:48714:11"/>
            <p n="8">§.8. Therefore this only remains, <hi>That he, that at his preſent can uphold himſelf, muſt needs have had that Power from all Eternity:</hi> For it is impoſſible, that he that once up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds himſelf, ſhould not always have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held himſelf; <hi>Becauſe the ſuſtaining of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf includes independency of all others;</hi> Now he that depends upon no other, cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have been Created by any other, or by himſelf: of another not, becauſe to be Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated infers a dependency, as we have juſt now ſhewed, which therefore is a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to this Propoſition, in which we ſpeak of a Being that can uphold it ſelf. It implys alſo a contradiction to Create him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Becauſe Creation includes a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of an own-outworking (as ſhall be proved §. 27.) If then any one ſhould Create himſelf, he muſt have had an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working, before he had been created, that is, before he could Work. Which implies a contradiction, becauſe to Create himſelf, is to produce ſomething, before one has power ſo to do: So that this Difficulty vaniſhes of it ſelf. Yea neceſſarily implyes, <hi>That, that Being, that upholds it ſelf, is uncrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and has alwayes maintained it ſelf in that ſtate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">§. 9. For as much then as a Man learns from his own inſufficiency, that there muſt needs be a Being, that brought him forth,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48714:11"/>and upholds him, which neceſſarily infers' that that Being is uncreated and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, as already is proved, he can further infer from hence, (tho' but imperfectly, by reaſon of his ſhortneſs of underſtanding) what Perfections are neceſſarily required in this uncreated Being.</p>
            <p n="10">§. 10. Having thus learned from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our own Being, that that Being, which creates us, is, and always was, it ſelf uncreated, we do juſtly conclude further, that it is alſo <hi>Vnchangeable:</hi> for if it were changeable in the leaſt, with reſpect to its Being, it were abſolutely impoſſible that it ſhould have been always uncreated: becauſe to be uncreated and independant cannot ſubſiſt with the leaſt mutability: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to be uncreated does neceſſarily imply a Being, that can neither be better nor worſe, but which always works the ſame thing; becauſe it depends upon no other, (according to §.8.) and conſequently cannot be changed by any other.</p>
            <p>This being cannot change it ſelf, but it muſt be either with reſpect to its thoughts, operations, or Being.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to its thoughts or works, it cannot change it ſelf, becauſe a mutation of thought or operation, implyes a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſomething Eſſential, which it, till
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48714:12"/>then had not thought, or had not till then done, and made an end of that which it did before Work or do. And in as much as it is natural to, or the property of a thinking Being to think, it follows that there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the leaſt change of thought, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a change of ſomething eſſential, which cannot happen in this uncreated Being, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would then be defective, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, which is inconſiſtent with the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of it ſelf, as ſhall be proved §. 11. as alſo with its Omnipreſence, and Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, of which we ſhall ſpeak §. 14.15.</p>
            <p>True it is, that it may here be Objected, That tho' a man changes in his thoughts, and actions, that that makes no change in his Being.</p>
            <p>But this is a <hi>falſe</hi> Objection: for ſeing our Thoughts, and Works, proceed not, but from our Life; and that we bring not forth any thing, but as cauſed thereby, it follows that no change can happen in our thoughts, neither for the better, nor the worſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept our Life or Being do firſt change ſo to work.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to his Being, this uncrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Being cannot change himſelf, becauſe then he muſt either become better or worſe: For the worſe he cannot change himſelf, becauſe 'tis natural to all things, to keep themſelves in a good State ſo long as they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48714:12"/>can poſſibly: Nor can he better himſelf, becauſe then he muſt have that power of himſelf, or have received it of ſome others. Of another can he not have received it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he upholds himſelf, (according to §. 8.) And it cannot make it ſelf better; becauſe that which upholds it ſelf, and is uncreated, muſt needs have had that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from all Eternity, which 'tis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that it has obtained in proceſs of time. From all which then it follows, that this uncreated Being is alſo <hi>unchangeable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">§. 11. For as much then as this Being is <hi>Vnchangeable</hi> both in its <hi>Thoughts, Works</hi> and <hi>Being,</hi> it is impoſſible to conceive wherein it ſhould be lyable to the leaſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection; for being uncreated and uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it ſelf, according to §. 6. and 7. it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have the leaſt imperfection, becauſe that which upholds it ſelf muſt needs have all Perfections, becauſe in that part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ſhould be imperfect, it would not be able to uphold it ſelf; becauſe every thing that is lyable to the leaſt defect, ſhews that it upholds not it ſelf; for if it could up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it ſelf, and yet was in any wiſe defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, it would in ſtead of being ſo defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, render it ſelf Perfect, and abide in that ſtate of Perfection.</p>
            <p>And for as much as §. 10. it is proved,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48714:13"/>that this uncreated Being is unchangeable, it neceſſarily follows, that it enjoys all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, becauſe that which cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed nor diminiſhed, without increaſing, and diminiſhing its Being, muſt needs poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs all things that can poſſibly be given: now that which perfectly enjoys all things, and admits not of the leaſt deficiency muſt <hi>in every reſpect be Perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">§. 12. For as much then as this being is abſolutely <hi>Perfect,</hi> it neceſſarily follows, that it is alſo <hi>Indiviſible</hi> or <hi>Incorporeal,</hi> becauſe all things that are Corporeal, and conſequently diviſible, ſhew themſelves to be mutable, as it is natural to all Bodies to change their Figures and forms, and becauſe it is proved §. 10. that God is not in the Ieaſt mutable, it follows thence, that the leaſt corporeity, or diviſibility cannot be eſſential to him.</p>
            <p n="13">§. 13. From this Immutability and Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibility follows, <hi>that no time can be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in this perfect Being.</hi> Becauſe time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing elſe but a certain Limit, which Men conceive in themſelves, of the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things that occur unto them, to wit, when they began, how long they ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and when they ſhall paſs away; for as much then as God is uncreated and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, he cannot be limited by any
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48714:13"/>time, in which he ſould have obtained his being, or how long he has been in that ſtate, becauſe to be uncreated, and unchangeable, implys no time, but perpetual duration ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to §. 7.</p>
            <p n="14">§. 14. Seing then there is no time in God, it neceſſarily follows <hi>that all things are preſent to him,</hi> that is, that nothing doth now appear, or come forth to View, that hath not been always, with God. For if any thing were new to God, God could not be alwayes preſent to all things, or all things would not be always and without ceaſing preſent to God; but would begin to be preſent to him; and ſeing there is no time in God (according to §. 13.) nothing can be ſaid in the leaſt to begin to be preſent to God, which has not always been preſent to him.</p>
            <p>But it will be here ſaid: That God is alwayes preſent; that is, that God is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes preſent to all created Beings, when created, but that he cannot be ſaid to be preſent to things before they are Created.</p>
            <p>This Objection indeed to our humane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and according to our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of things, as preſent to us, ſeems to include a truth; but becauſe we our ſelves are never preſent, but always under
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48714:14"/>mutation, and that all things that occur un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, do alſo continually change (as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Obſervations of Baron <hi>Van Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> upon Man, and his Diſeaſes §. 39.40, 41, 42.) therefore Gods being preſent cannot be conſidered in the ſame manner, or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured with our manner of being preſent to things, becauſe he is unchangeable, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually changing.</p>
            <p>Beſides when we ſay, concerning any Creature, that it is preſent, we mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but that we hear or ſee it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in this or that place; But on this wiſe can nothing be ſaid to be preſent to God, becauſe, he being incorporeal, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to §. 12. cannot be externally ſeen nor included in any place. But muſt be ſo preſent, that nothing can be or ſubſiſt out of him; ſeeing then, that nothing can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt out of God (as ſhall be proved §. 16.) and that God is in all reſpects unchangeable (according to §. 10.) God muſt needs be preſent to all things on that wiſe; that is, he muſt have all things in him: For if God, began then firſt to be preſent to all things, when they were created, or firſt began to be, then ſhould God neceſſarily be now preſent to ſome things, to which he was not preſent in former times. Which would be ſomething new to God; and becauſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry new thing infers a Change, whether in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48714:14"/>thought or deed, and that God is in every reſpect, unchangeable (according to §. 10.) it is impoſſible that God ſhould not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preſent to all things.</p>
            <p>But it will be here again ſaid, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is a conſequence of the Creation, and that therefore this has relation only to the Creation, and not with reſpect to the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes that flow from the Being of God it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But this exception is utterly falſe: for if it flows from the nature of Gods Being, that he be unchangeable, and perfect, then it follows alſo from his Being, that he cannot with reſpect to his Works or Being, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended or inlarged: Now, that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be extended nor inlarged, cannot be ſaid to be preſent to more things at this time, then in time paſt: at one time then another. For if it was not preſent but in the Creation, and the Creation be (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common opinion) ſomething, that before was <hi>nothing,</hi> then this Being muſt be more extended now, than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe there being nothing before the Creation, (according to the common Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis) this being could not be operative in that, which was not; and God being more preſent with reſpect to the Creation, muſt needs be now more extended with reſpect to his Being or Works than he was
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48714:15"/>before the Creation, which is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to §. 10. where the contrary is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: So that this exception, that Gods preſence is a conſequence of the Creation falls to the ground.</p>
            <p>Again they which do conſider Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent, but as a conſequence of the Creation, cannot conceive God to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent any other way, then man is ſaid to be preſent to things; altho' they ſeem to ſay the Contrary. Now the difference betwixt Gods being preſent and Mans being ſo, and wherein it conſiſts, has been ſhewed in the precedent Objection.</p>
            <p>But in oppoſition to theſe our thoughts concerning Gods Preſence, there will be another difficulty advanced, <hi>viz.</hi> How it is conceivable, that all things ſhould have been in God, as they are before their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. And that this being to us utterly unconceivable, ſeems therefore to be falſe.</p>
            <p>For my part I freely confeſs, that it is unconceivable to Men, after what manner or how theſe things were in God before the Creation: buth tho' my underſtanding can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive it, it follows not that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is falſe: for if nothing elſe be true but what I can comprehend, it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that all the Attributes of God are not in him, yea that God is not, becauſe God is incomprehenſible: Which conſequence yet
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48714:15"/>is abſurd, as is proved §. 2.3. even ſo is it unreaſonable to infer ſuch conſequences from our comprehenſion with reſpect to Gods preſence.</p>
            <p>Moreover if we truly underſtand, what Creating is, (as ſhall be ſhewed §. 27.) this difficulty would fall of it ſelf. To ſhew then in ſome ſort the poſſibility of all things having been always preſent to God: Let us conſider, that all our words, thoughts and deeds, are not a meer nothing, but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual beings (as is proved in the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of B. <hi>Van Helmonts Obſervation upon man</hi> &amp;c §. 19.44, 45, 76, 86, 91, 93, &amp;c.) And that they often times are ſeen by others, before they are acted in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; as for example it is ſufficiently known, and eſpecially to ſuch as have it by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the apparition of one that is yet alive will be repreſented to another, and that the very ſame noiſe or din, which afterwards will be heard at the death of the Perſon, is heard before his departure: Theſe things now, which are ſo heard or ſeen, and of which we have a clear evidence, as when we ſpeak with the Perſons themſelves, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meer nothings, becauſe no man can hear or ſee a meer nothing: but theſe are ſomething eſſential (as is proved in the Conſiderations of B <hi>Van Helmont;</hi>) I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then what greater impoſſibility there is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48714:16"/>in this, that all things are always preſent to God, than it is that men ſhould ſometimes perceive things beforehand, that come not to paſs till ſometime after, there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference here, but in point of time, to wit, that God has been alwayes preſent to all things, which men many times have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſeen, and heard but ſome ſmall time, before they were wrought out: So that this plainly evinces that all natural things do already really exiſt, before they were wrought out, tho' we kmow not how.</p>
            <p>And becauſe we do here give a Key, by which we may underſtand the poſſibility of Apparitions, we muſt as we go, take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of two miſtakes, conerning Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and Apparitions. Firſt of thoſe that look upon Propheſies, &amp; Apparitions as Fables, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot conceive how things can be ſeen or known before they come to paſs, not knowing that all things are always eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, altho' not viſible. Secondly of thoſe that receive Propheſies, and Apparitions for truth in oppoſition to the former, altho' they cannot give the leaſt reaſon for it, yea if they do not acknowledge that all things do eſſentially exiſt, before they be corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>really wrought out, will be forced to aſſent to the opinion of the former, as not having any thing to oppoſe againſt it, becauſe ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Truth aſide, that all things have
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48714:16"/>always been eſſentially in God, there is not the leaſt proof to be given of the truth of Propheſies and Apparitions.</p>
            <p n="15">§. 15. And becauſe all things are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually preſent to God, this moſt perfect Being muſt alſo needs be <hi>Omniſcient,</hi> that is, God knows when and at what time all things, that are hid ſhall be revealed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, being the Original of all things (as ſhall be proved §. 17.) and having all things preſent with him (according to §. 14.) he knows, when this or that thing ſhall (in the order that he has eſtabliſht in all things) be bodily wrought forth, that is, when it ſhall bodily appear, or be acted in the Body, (for of ſuch things as are to be done in the body, it is, that we now (ſpeak,)</p>
            <p>Yea it is altogether impoſſible, that any man can have any the leaſt Notion or Idea of the ſignification of <hi>Omniſcience</hi> if he does not preſuppoſe, that all things are always preſent to God: and to ſpeak yet plainer, it is impoſſible that God can be Ominiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent if all things be not preſent to him: For I pray, <hi>what is it to know a thing,</hi> but to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it?</hi> And we muſt needs have the Idea or being of what we do comprehend; and hence it is, that he that has no Idea or Image of a thing, does not truly apprehend it: For as much then as the knowledge of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48714:17"/>a thing conſiſts in the having and Idea there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and that the Ideas are Spiritual Beings, (as is proved in the Conſiderations of B. <hi>Van Helmont</hi> upon Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> §. 44.45.) it follows, becauſe God has in him the Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as (or that which is eſſential) of all things, which are always preſent to him, that he muſt needs be alſo <hi>Omniſcient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it will be ſaid, that knowledge in God, is not ſo as it is in man, becauſe God has all knowledge from himſelf, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all things, ſo as they ſhall be when they ſhall begin to appear in the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, whereas, on the contrary, Men muſt receive their Ideas from without, from the things themſelves, which do give forth their Ideas or Images In us; and therefore the Omniſcience of God cannot be likened to the knowledge of Man.</p>
            <p>But this Objection ſays nothing againſt what we have advanced: For we ſay not that the knowledge of God is to be liken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the knowledge of Man; but that Gods knowledge, is knowledge, and that all knowledge infers an <hi>Idea of the thing known, or which we comprehend.</hi> As for Example, no man can know what a Tree, or Beaſt, or ſuch like is, unleſs he has the Idea or Image of that thing in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The difference then betwixt Gods knowledge and our knowledge conſiſts herein, that we cannot
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48714:17"/>frame any Idea of any thing, but what the things themſelves, gives forth,</hi> ſo that the knowledge of the Creatures is ſtirred up in us, and hence it is, that no man can form in himſelf and Idea or Image of anything, that he has never ſeen. But it is not thus with the knowledge of God, but the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to wit, That God ſtands in need of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to acquire the knowledge thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he being the Original of all things (as ſhall be proved in the next §.) and wanting nothing, but on the contrary, enjoying all Perfections according to §. 11. produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth all things, and is the Author of them: <hi>So that the difference betwixt Gods and Mans knowledge, is this, that men are paſſive, that is, they cannot know, nor work any Idea of any thing unto themſelves but muſt receive it from without: whereas on the contrary, the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Being is active, that is, it wants no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from without, but knows all things from or of himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that hence it may be eaſily enough un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that we do not liken the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God unto Mans knowledge, but do aſſert an infinite diſtance betwixt the one and the other.</p>
            <p>But this is not the main Buſineſs, that we properly aim at here, to wit, what Gods knowledge is, and how men come by the knowledge they have: But the queſtion
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48714:18"/>here is, what is knowledge. And we have ſhewed, that all knowledge or comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, if it be true knowledge, includes in it an Idea or figure of the thing, which we comprehend, or elſe it is no knowledge of the thing as it is: but only that ſuch a thing is, as by Example we know indeed that God is, but we know not what manner of being he is, that is, we have no Idea in us of his Being as is proved §. 2.3.</p>
            <p>But here we ſpeak not properly of ſuch a thing, as of which we can have no Idea, but of things which fall under perception and Comprehenſion. For we treat here of the Being of God, which is greater than all Created things, and therefore his <hi>Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> muſt needs comprehend the knowledge or comprehenſion of all things, ſo as things ſhall be created. And therefore we are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conſider here that knowledge, which contains only the Idea or being of the thing known: which knowledge muſt needs be in the moſt perfect being, <hi>viz.</hi> that it has in it ſelf the Ideas of all things ſo as they ſhall be created, or elſe God could not be <hi>Omniſcient,</hi> that is, he could not comprehend all things, are not a meer nothing (as has been ſhewed already) nor cannot be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; Becauſe in God there cannot be <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> but muſt all be actually and eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48714:18"/>according to his perfection; whence then follows beyond all contradictions that God had all things eſſentially in him before the Creation, and that he can in no wiſe be <hi>Omniſcient,</hi> but by having the Ideas, (or that which is eſſential) of all things in him, and conſequently that all things did not then firſt obtain their Beings, in their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, but were all before the Creation eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially in God.</p>
            <p n="16">§. 16. This moſt perfect Being then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus Omniſcient, that all things are preſent to him, <hi>it muſt needs be the Original of all Created things;</hi> becauſe he that has all things preſent, that is, he that compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all things, is greater than the things that are preſent to him, that is, that are comprehended in or by him. Now theſe things that are always preſent to God, do ſhew their deficiency and want of power to keep themſelves always in the ſame condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe they continually change: Now for as much as they do not uphold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they cannot poſſibly be the cauſe of their own Being; becauſe he that is the cauſe of his own Being, muſt needs have the Power of having been always the cauſe of his own being, and conſequently he muſt be able to preſerve himſelf in the ſame ſtate. Now for as much as no Creature has the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48714:19"/>power of Conſerving it ſelf in the ſame frame, it follows, that ſome other muſt be the cauſe of its being; and he that is the cauſe of its being cannot be like unto him, that is, he cannot be as he is, a Creature, becauſe no Creature has the leaſt power of producing any thing, nor yet ſo much as of Conſerving it ſelf for one Moment (as in §. 4.5, 6.) ſo that <hi>the Original or Cauſe of the Creatures</hi> can be no Creature, but muſt be that being, which is from all Eternity, which ſubſiſts of it ſelf, and to whom all things are preſent.</p>
            <p n="17">§. 17. Seing then that God is thus Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient, that all things ae continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with him, and ſo preſent that they are dependent of him, and that he is the Cauſe or Original of all things, it neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that this perfect Being, has alſo this Power, that he can ſo produce all things, that what he produceth ſhall be able to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the end, to which their maker has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them. Becauſe he, of whom all things are dependant, and who is the ſole Cauſe of all things, cannot be ſo hindred by any thing, that what he has produced ſhould not effect that which is according to his aim and will: which power of producing all things is truly enough ſaid to be <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent:</hi> Not that the word <hi>Omnipotent</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:48714:19"/>does ſignifie a power to do all things both good and evil; in no wiſe: For ſeing there is no defect in God, it cannot be that the moſt perfect Being ſhould produce or work out any thing that ſhould not have all the parts requiſit to its appointed out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working; but if his work ſhould be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectively produced, it would be evil with reſpect to God, who is the Work-maſter, or the Maker thereof, but this cannot in any wiſe be in a perfect Being.</p>
            <p n="18">§. 18. And as this Being is ſo Powerful, that it produces all things with thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, that render them capable of Effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, whereunto they are ordained and appointed, ſo it is alſo, not only <hi>Good</hi> in or with reſpect to its ſelf (which Goodneſs, <hi>in that reſpect,</hi> is nothing elſe but its own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection (of which we have ſpoken §. 11.) but it muſt needs alſo be good in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree, with reſpect to the Creatures; becauſe all the Good which is required to their Well-being, they muſt receive from him, as not being able to ſubſiſt out of him.</p>
            <p n="19">§. 19. And this Perfection in the Divine Being, being demonſtrated in §. 11. it follows that it cannot be <hi>without Operation,</hi> becauſe if it were not Operative, it would if ſelf want that which is common to every
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48714:20"/>Creature; for there is no Creature, how mean ſoever it be, that is without its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: Now if the moſt perfect Being ſhould want that which is even Natural to all the Creatures, it would in that reſpect be more deficient then the Creatures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor would poſſibly have all thoſe Perfections that are neceſſary to a perfect Being.</p>
            <p n="20">§. 20. Again this being is not only ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, but it muſt needs have been <hi>always</hi> on <hi>Continually Operative,</hi> becauſe if it be not always Operative, there would then be a ceſſation in this being, either from all Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or but in part. Whether now we ſay, that this Ceſſation be total or but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, it aſſerts a change, and that infers a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or imperfection, as is more at large proved in §. 10. And ſeing, according to §. 10. and 11. God is neither Mutable in his Being nor in his Working, but is in every reſpect preſent, it follows, that God muſt <hi>always have been Operative or Working.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="21">§. 21. And ſeing the Immutability of this Being is proved §. 10. and its Perfection in §. 11, it follows, that it is not only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Operative, <hi>but alſo that it muſt always Operate or work the ſame thing:</hi> That is, that God does not only never ceaſe to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48714:20"/>work, but alſo, that he does not change his Working; becauſe if God did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways work the ſame thing, it muſt be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he might make his Work better or worſe: But this Being makes its work neither better nor worſe: Becauſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it works, muſt be agreeable with its own Attributes; ſeing therefore that it is unchangeably perfect according to §. 10. and 11. it muſt neceſſarily have alſo that Perfection that it works always wifely and with underſtanding, yea with ſuch under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that there can be neither too much nor too little in its Works, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that it produceth its Works nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better nor worſe, or elſe there would be a defect in the Nature of this Being, and conſequently it would neither be immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table nor perfect, the contrary of which has been proved.</p>
            <p>And becauſe there is no time in God, that is, becauſe his Being cannot be limited by any time (according to §. 13.) but that it is perpetual, therefore, the Attributes that flow from his Divine Being, cannot be temporal, or ſubject to time. Becauſe we can no ſooner ſpeak of a Being, but we muſt needs include all the eſſential Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes thereof; for if you take from a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Attributes, it is no more the ſame thing that it was before, and ſeing in §. 18.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48714:21"/>it is proved that Operation, or to Work is natural to the Divine Being, it follows, that becauſe God is every way unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that his Working muſt alſo be ſo, and that it can never ceaſe to be the ſame.</p>
            <p>Moreover, if God did not always work the ſame thing, but did work ſomething new, the eſſential of which was not before, then God could not be preſent to all things, becauſe that which did but now begin firſt to be, or to receive Being, cannot be ſaid to be preſent before its being; And for as much as it is proved §. 14. that all things are preſent with God, God cannot at this time work out or produce any other Beings, but thoſe, which were continually preſent to him; and conſequently, becauſe all things are always preſent to God, God muſt needs alwayes work the ſame and no new thing.</p>
            <p>And ſeing Gods Omniſiciency does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that he hath the eſſential of all things in him, according to §. 15. therefore God cannot work any new thing, that is, which is eſſentially ſo, and which God is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways working, becauſe if God did work out or produce any thing that is new, he could not be ſaid to be Omniſcient, of which we have ſpoke more at large §. 15.</p>
            <p>From all which if follows, that <hi>God muſt needs be always working the ſame thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any one will here alledge, that it does
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48714:21"/>not follow that the Divine-Being does always word the ſame thing; becauſe this Being does all things freely and without conſtraint, and conſequently can either ceaſe from his former Work, or begin a new Work, be ſhall find, that he makes the will of God to contradict his immutability, which cannot conſiſt with the nature of the moſt perfect Being.</p>
            <p>But becauſe this Objection ariſes from ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Nature of the free will of God, therefore we ſhall make anſwer to it, when we come to Treat of the Freedom of the Will of God, to wit, in the next 22. §.</p>
            <p>It will again perhaps be ſaid, tho' that God always Works the ſame thing, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his own Being, that is, that he can never change his own Perfection, yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not from hence, that God does always work the ſame thing, as to his works which he has made; As for Example, before the World was Created Good produced not any thing, that was not his own Being, but was Operative in himſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> All-ſuficient: For we can conceive or think upon the moſt perfect being, tho' we think not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Creatures; ſo that if flows not from the nature of his Being, that he muſt needs always Create.</p>
            <p>As to this diſtinction betwixt Gods Working with reſpect to the Working,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48714:22"/>which is in God, and his Working with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Works that he makes, tho' it ſeems to ſay ſomething, yet in the ground it ſays nothing: For when we ſay that God always works the ſame thing with reſpect to his Being; does not <hi>that neceſſarily imply,</hi> that God does always work the ſame thing, and always doth that which follows from his perfect Being, if therefore it follows from the nature of this Being, that he can Create, and that he is withal unchangeable, both with reſpect to his Being, and to his Working, (according to §. 10.) can any thing elſe follow from hence (without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the eſſential immutability of God) but that God always Creates? It is ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſeparate theſe two from each other, that if we will aſſert, that God does not always work the ſame thing, we ſhall in very deed deny the immutability of God, which in Words we do confeſs.</p>
            <p>Beſides, when we diſtinguiſh betwixt Gods Working with reſpect to his own Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Works which he makes, and do thence conclude, that God can work in himſelf without bringing forth any thing, but his own Being; we muſt conſider, whence we have this diſtinction.</p>
            <p>This is certain, that we are conſcious to our ſelves, that we can think upon a thing, without preſently executing what we think;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48714:22"/>yea, that we can according to our own Will, do or omit divers things, without conſidering whether it be regular or no. This forbearing to put in Execution what we <hi>have once</hi> thought, proceeds not ſo much from our own Will or Choice, many times, as from a want of Power to do it; for the Nature of all men is ſuch, that as ſoon as they have conſidered that a thing is good or profitable to them, they do immediately wiſh and deſire to put it in Execution, and becauſe they do many times want power ſo to do, or that long time is thereunto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, they do forbear to accompliſh their Deſigns; or elſe, if they wanted not for power, they would immediatly put them in Execution.</p>
            <p>If any man ſhall pretend that a Man ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conſiders of things, that he can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly do, and yet forbears, the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, whether thoſe things be good or evil. If Good, the omiſſion of them is a neglect and a defect in him; becauſe it is always neceſſary that he ſhould do good, that is, that which the order of things does require (for Evil is that which is contrary to the appointed Order) and for him to forbear it, is wrong. We muſt not feign then (from our own deficiency) ſuch things in God, as are inconſiſtent with his Perfection, and are a clear Proof of a defect in our
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48714:23"/>ſelves. So I leave it to every man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether ſuch a diſtinction can poſſibly be admitted in the Working of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the diminution of his Perfection.</p>
            <p>And when it is ſaid, that God was all-ſufficient and <hi>Operative in himſelf before the Creation of the World,</hi> if we conſider the thing aright, we ſhall find, that they that uſe this manner of Speech, do neither ſay any thing that is intelligible to others, nor in any wiſe do underſtand themſelves what they ſay. For when they ſay that God worketh in himſelf, or is all-ſufficient; do they not ſignify thereby, that God ſtands in need of nothing, neither wanteth any thing from any one, but is independant of any Creature. I take this to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſence of theſe words, which thoſe that uſe this manner of Speech would ſignify thereby. But tho'this be the true meaning of theſe Words, yet it is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in this caſe: For I pray obſerve, to what Queſtion this Anſwer is given, to wit: When any one asks, what did God do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he Created the Worlds? The common anſwer is, God wrought in himſelf, or God was all-ſufficient. Verily an anſwer for Children, but not for Men of Senſe; for this is not the Queſtion, whether God had the ſame perfections before the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as after: Neither do we here ſpeak of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48714:23"/>the Being of God, but of his Works, ſo that it is juſt as if the one inquired after the Eaſt, and the other directed him to the Weſt. Again if we ſift this Anſwer a little more narrowly, we ſhall find a leſſening of Gods Perfections: for to ſay that God was all-ſufficient, or wrought in himſelf before the Creation, is as if they would ſignify that ſince the Creation God was not ſo. For what elſe can it ſignify in this place? Or if this be not their meaning, but that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo aſſert God to be alwayes unchangeable, it is not to the purpoſe, and they ſhew there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that they are not able to anſwer that Queſtion: What God did before the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation? they ought to ſay, that God ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Created ſomething or nothing: If they ſay, that God Created nothing before <hi>this World,</hi> they ought to prove, that that follows from the Nature of God himſelf; as on the contrary they ought to require of us, that we ſhould prove our aſſertion: that God is always a Creator, and Creating from the nature of that Divine Being.</p>
            <p>But againſt this poſition, that God is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Working the ſame thing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is always Creating, there is one ſhift more, <hi>viz.</hi> That we can conceive the moſt perfect Being, without conceiving that God is alwayes Creating, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it flows not
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48714:24"/>from the Nature of God that he is always Creating.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we muſt here conſider, that Man cannot at once conceive all Gods Prefecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for reaſons rendred in §. 2. So that it is no wonder, that we ſpeaking of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, do not think upon his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Creating, juſt as when a man is treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Wiſdom of God, he then thinks not upon his Ominipotency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if by the Word <hi>conceive</hi> they do not mean to <hi>think upon</hi> ſuch an Attribute of God, but that they cannot ſee from the Attributes of God, that he muſt needs be always Creating and Working the ſame thing, they have not narrowly enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, what is neceſſarily required in the moſt perfect Being, and we pray them ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to weigh what we have ſaid, §. 8.19, 20. concerning Gods Working, in which the Work of Creating is included. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, if any one ſays, that he can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the Being of God, although he does not conceive in that thought, that God is always Creating, I ask ſuch an one whether he can know that there is a God, but by and from the Creation? If yea, then he himſelf muſt not be a Creature; if not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, being himſelf a Creature, and thence learning to know God, how can he think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, without conceiving, that he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48714:24"/>Creating? Seing his own Being teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es him that God Creates, and that God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wants the power that he hath, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the ſame unchangeable in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. No Creature can then think a right of God without conceiving him, as always creating.</p>
            <p n="22">§. 22. But albeit God be always work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame thing, yet what he does, he does freely, or without Conſtraint; that is, it flows from the Nature it ſelf of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being ſo to do continually; nor is he thereunto conſtrained by any other; elſe he could not be ſaid to be Omnipotent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to §. 17.) if he had not ſuch à <hi>Free</hi> or unconſtrained Will. Again it's neceſſary, or muſt needs be, that the Divine Being has a <hi>Free-Will,</hi> becauſe this Being upholding it ſelf (according to §. 8.) is dependant of no other, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no body has power to conſtrain this Being in any thing.</p>
            <p>But becauſe many do not know that we muſt ſo conſider the particular Attributes of God, that the one does not contradict the other, but being joyned together do all agree in one; therefore there are many idle and needleſs Queſtions brought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Free-will of God, which are generally propounded: <hi>viz. Whether God
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48714:25"/>can Will contradictory things? Whether God could have Created this World otherwiſe than he has?</hi> and ſuch like Trifles, which are not once worth the thinking upon, but howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to anſwer them all at once.</p>
            <p>We muſt conſider, <hi>What Free-Will <hi>is in God,</hi>
               </hi> and what it cannot poſſibly be. <hi>The Free-Will in God then is nothing elſe, but that God Wills that all things ſhould be ſo produced, that each Creature be indued with ſuch Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, Properties or Faculties, as are requiſit to ſuch a Creature, that it may perform that which God aims at thereby,</hi> in ſhort: <hi>Gods Free-Will differs nothing from his Almightineſs,</hi> and is only a different Name to the ſame At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, as may be ſeen §. 17. compared with this §. 22.</p>
            <p>For as much then as it flows from the Nature of the moſt perfect Being, that he ſhould produce all things in the manner which is moſt agreeable to his Wiſdom, that is, that they ſhould neither have too much nor too little, it is impoſſible from the nature of God himſelf, that he ſhould do contradictory things, or that he could Create the World otherwiſe. Yea ſuch Queſtions, whether God could do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſigniſies that thoſe that ask them, do conceive in themſelves ſomething better, or do imagine that they could have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the World in a better way than it is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48714:25"/>now Created, which they muſt prove (yet ſo, that it could not at all contradict any of the Attributes of God) or elſe their Queſtion is vain and Fruitleſs, and they ſay they know not what.</p>
            <p>But this wrong apprehenſion of the Free-will of God, to wit, this conceit that God could Will otherwiſe then he now Wills, have men borrowed from their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe they find in themſelves a liberty to will this or that, they thence conclude, that the Will in God muſt alſo be thus free, &amp; for this very Reaſon many do aſſert an indifferency of Will in God; juſt as if God could be as man, indifferent to do or to forbear a thing; never conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this indifferency of will in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves is but an effect of Ignorance, and want of Experience, for which cauſe it is that they know not what to do, nor what to forbear. As for an Example, A man that is convinced, that to do this or that thing is certainly good, will not do the contrary, no nor yet neglect to do that, if he will give way to reaſon, and love the good.</p>
            <p>But many times not knowing which is beſt, he ballances in himſelf, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inclines to this, ſometimes to that. So that this <hi>Free-will</hi> or <hi>Indifferency of Will</hi> in man, is but the effect of Ignorance. This being ſo, it is impoſſible that God ſhould
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48714:26"/>have any ſuch Free-will or Indifferency in him of doing or forbearing a thing; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God being perfect and Omniſcient, cannot be ignorant of the leaſt thing, but knows all things; and muſt produce all in the beſt manner, whence then follows, that God knowing all things cannot ſtand in any indifferency to do or to forbear a thing, becauſe then God would not know all things after the moſt perfect manner, if he could will or incline to do a thing or not to do it. Yea to aſſert ſuch a Freedom or <hi>Indifferency of Will</hi> in God, is utterly inconſiſtent with the Attributes of God, and is ſufficient to ſet the Attributes of God at odds one with the other, as every one can eaſily perceive from what has been here ſaid, if he will but examine it well.</p>
            <p n="23">§. 23. For as much then, as it follows from the very nature of the moſt perfect Being, that it is always working the ſame thing, we muſt conſider, what is meant by Gods Working? <hi>Among the Works of God are to be underſtood the continual Creating and upholding of all Beings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="24">§. 24. By the continual upholding of the Beings we underſtand, that all things which are always preſent with God (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to §. 14. do continually receive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48714:26"/>from God, to perſiſt in their State; <hi>For albeit they had no beginning, nor ſhall ever ceaſe to be preſent to God,</hi> yet they have not that Perfection that they can uphold themſelves: All Creatures, and none ſo much as our own beings, do teach us this, which ſhews that we are deſicient and full of wants, and cannot uphold our ſelves in the leaſt, as is proved §. 4.5. For as much then, as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not uphold our ſelves now, it follows, that our Being could not uphold it ſelf before its Creation, becauſe that which could once uphold it ſelf, can never be deprived of that power, as is ſhewed §. 7. and would therefore be unchangeable according to §. 10. For as much then as we find in our ſelves a continual change, and that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not uphold our ſelves, it follows, that all things which are always preſent to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being, as well as our own Being, are continually upheld by God, and cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of themſelves.</p>
            <p>And altho' it flows from Gods Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſence and Ominiſcience, that nothing of the things that are, has had either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or end, but have always been, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to §. 20. yet hence follows not at all, that thoſe Beings, that are in God, and that are Created, are therefore the Divine being it ſelf.</p>
            <p>For in the firſt place, it is not only neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48714:27"/>ſary that the moſt perfect Being ſhould be Infinite, but alſo, that it ſhould not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by another, nor upheld, but by it ſelf alone. Yea, that it ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable and ſuch like. And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, albeit the Beings or Creatures have neither beginning nor end, yet they are not therefore unchangeable, nor able to uphold themſelves, becauſe their endleſneſs or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity flows not from their own Being, but from the Being of God, which, becauſe it is always working and unchangeable, muſt needs continually (that is, without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or end) be preſent to all things as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that albeit all Beings are without beginning, yet they are not therefore the Divine Being, but do differ infinitely from the ſame, and the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof: as for Example, Whereas God is always of and from himſelf, without depending upon any other, they are always depending upon God, and not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; whereas God is the Original of all things, they are but an Outworking, and ſo cannot produce the leaſt thing: Whereas God is unchangcable, they are in perpetual Mutation: Whereas God is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, they are deficient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it in the leaſt inconſiſtent with the nature of Man, to conceive two Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, albeit they infinitely differ in their
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48714:27"/>Perfections: For ſeing we know that God is the moſt perfect being, in whom is no Variableneſs at all, it follows from hence alſo that there cannot be the leaſt change in his knowledge, or working, as is ſhewed §. 10. And ſeing there can be no change, neither in the knowledge, nor in the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, we may from hence learn the Poſſibility of Gods Works, being infinite or without end or beginning, while yet they are every way ſhort of the Perfection of God, as has been ſhewed.</p>
            <p n="25">§. 25. And to ſhew that even they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that do deny that all beings are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning or end, do eſtabliſh the ſame thing, altho' in Words they deny it; Let us but once ſee what they mean by the word <hi>Infinite:</hi> They ſay then that <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> ſignifies, Firſt, that which has neither beginning nor end; but that in that reſpect God is only to be infinite. Seconly by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite</hi> they underſtand ſomewhat that has a beginning but no end, and thus they make man <hi>Infinite</hi> or endleſs.</p>
            <p>But who taught them, that the Word <hi>Infinite</hi> has ſo different Significantions? whence do they infer this? or with what certainty can they prove this various ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the word <hi>Infinite,</hi> or endleſs? methinks I ſee how this diſtinction was firſt hatcht: to wit, becauſe they were not able
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48714:28"/>to make a right diſtinction betwixt Gods infiniteneſs, and that of the Creature; and that if they ſhould aſſert the Creatures to be without all beginning, they would differ nothing from the being of God; juſt as if all that had no beginning muſt needs be God himſelf (the contrary of which has been proved §. 22.) Wherefore to cover their Ignorance, and to have ſomething to anſwer to their Adverſaries, they invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Diſtinction upon the Word <hi>Infinite, viz.</hi> that it betokens more things than one. A Being without beginning or end, as the Being of God, and a being with beginning but without end, as that of the Creatures: And that diſtinction was judged moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that ſo the being of God might not be injured, nor diminiſht in its honour on the one ſide, nor the Creature on the other ſide exalted too high by aſcribing any thing to it, that did not belong to it, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding does not at all follow from what we ſay, for tho' the Creature be alſo without beginning, yet it differs infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Divine Being, as may be ſeen §. 24.</p>
            <p>But to ſhew how well theſe men do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the honour of God, by giving this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſignification to the word <hi>Infinit,</hi> it will be needful to examine, what conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences muſt needs follows (with reſpect of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48714:28"/>the Being of God) from that ſaying, that the Creatures have indeed a beginning but no end; Thus, if the Creature firſt receives its Being, in its Creation, if follows cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, that God is not infinit in his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that is, that God does not always work the ſame thing, but has a beginning with reſpect to his Working, and ſo God is not infinit in his Working, which is a Contradiction to God and his Working, which are unchangeable according to §. 10. as alſo to §. 21. where it is proved, that God is always working the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>Beſides this would infer time or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing temporal in God &amp; ſo all things would not be always preſent to God (the contrary of which is proved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 13.14.) if Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had a beginning, and there muſt be in God a time, or beginning of working it; which is inconſiſtent with the continual preſence of God.</p>
            <p>It alſo contradicts Gods Omniſcience, that the being of the Creatures ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in time, becauſe all knowledge includes an Idea of the thing conceived. If then the being of things were firſt brought forth in time, then God could not always have had an Idea of all his Works, becauſe that Idea is the Being of the things, as is prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed §. 15. and ſo God, according to their Hypotheſis, could not be Omniſcient or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing.</p>
            <pb n="42" facs="tcp:48714:29"/>
            <p>From all which then it follows, that it Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the Perfection of God, to ſay that the Being of the Creatures had a beinning.</p>
            <p>Beſides when they ſay, that there are things that have a beginning but no end, the queſtion is, whether this be intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible or no? And whether they can ſhew us any one thing in Nature, that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, which has not alſo an end? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, as to the Creatures ſo far as they are viſible and tangible, they have not only a beginning, but alſo an end, as experience teaches us, in all the Creatures, to wit, that their bodies do change as to their Forms, and do not remain as they were at firſt formed: Yea there is nothing they can aſſign, that has had a beginning, which ſhall not alſo have an end; that is, that what they call a beginning, has not alſo its end.</p>
            <p>But he that ſhould conclude from theſe Words of mine, either ignorantly or mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, that therefore Man, becauſe he has a beginning, ſhall alſo have an end, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that there ſhall nothing remain of, nor for Man after this Life, would wreſt my words and make them ſay, the quite contrary of what I intend: For my aim in this is only to ſhew, that that, which has no end, can alſo not have had any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and that whats eſſential of man, <hi>viz.</hi> his Spirit, having no end, can alſo have had
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48714:29"/>no beginning, &amp; conſequently that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite. or without all end.</p>
            <p>But ſome Body will perhaps ſay, that he can conceive ſomething, that has had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but which ſhall have no end, and conſequently that it is not impoſſible nor contrary to nature: as for Example, we can conceive an infinite number, and an infinite Line, and theſe have a beginning, but no end.</p>
            <p>But this Objection duely conſidered, will not only fall, but even on the contrary ſerve for a proof, that that which has a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, has alſo an end: For Example, ſuppoſe any one conceive a number of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds or Millions of Thouſands, he can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways add ſomething to it; ſo that the number that any one conceives, has always an end, becauſe he can always augment it, and add more numbers to it. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſuppoſe any man draws a Line from a point; that Line cannot be endleſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he can always in his thoughts add un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the length. So that no man can imagine an endleſs line, but on the contrary, that as it had a beginning, ſo it ſhall alſo have an end.</p>
            <p>If any man yet ſays, that he can conceive a Line, that can be extended <hi>in infinitum,</hi> he ſays but the ſame thing over again in the ſame words, or all that he would ſay, is, that he can conceive a line, the end of which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48714:30"/>he knows not; for he that ſays, that he can conceive a Line, that may be in finitely extended, muſt have an Idea of it, or comprehend it in himſelf. Now this is moſt certain, that no man can frame in himſelf an Idea of Infinity; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that he cannot conceive a Line infinitly extended, and if he underſtands by a Line that can be infinitely extended only, a Line of whoſe end he is ignorant, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not at all, that therefore this line is infinit, but only that he knows not, where the end of it is, and therefore this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection totally evaniſhes.</p>
            <p n="26">§. 26. But it will be ſaid perhaps, you aſſert, that all Beings are endleſs, that is, That they have always been in God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning, and yet you ſay, that they were produced by God; <hi>Now all that is brought forth, preſuppoſes a beginning, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this your ſaying implyes a contradiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, that the word <hi>produce</hi> is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally uſed, for to cauſe ſomething to come forth, which was not before; but if we conſider it aright, we ſhall naturally find, that the word produce cannot ſignify to cauſe a thing now to come to view, which was not before in Being; for with reſpect to God, we have proved §. 14. that all things muſt needs have been eſſentially in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48714:30"/>God without beginning; and if they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it with reſpect to the Creatures, they the Creatures cannot produce any thing new, which has not eſſentially been before. So that according to the common uſe, the word <hi>Produce, cannot ſignify any thing elſe,</hi> but this, <hi>that theſe things that before were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, and not knowable, do now become viſible and diſcernable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to give them full meaſure, ſuppoſe that the Word <hi>Produce</hi> did neceſſarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe a beginning of that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, who ſhall furniſh me with a Word that ſignifies God to be the Author of all things, and yet that the Beings of all things have been in God, without all beginning? for that is <hi>my meaning</hi> by the word <hi>Produce,</hi> as every one can perceive by the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, in this caſe, we want Words, to expreſs it well by, becauſe our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding only conceives that, of which we can have an Idea in our Selves, and ſo far we can find Words, that ſignify the propertys of things; but becauſe our underſtanding can frame no Idea of any thing that is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit, therefore alſo do we want words, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to define that, of which we have no true Notion: And therefore can we only trace that, which neceſſarily flows from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, and deſcribe it defectively, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48714:31"/>to our deficient underſtanding; But he that will conſider it, and examine it well, will find that what we ſay is true and will underſtand more of it, than he ſhall be able to expreſs.</p>
            <p>But it will yet be ſaid, that that, which has no beginning, cannot be ſaid to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, but muſt be or ſubſiſt of it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But this is no neceſſary conſequence that becauſe a thing has no beginning, that it muſt therefore exiſt of it ſelf; for not to have beginning, and to exiſt of it ſelf, do not neceſſarily infer each other; but that a thing exiſts of it ſelf neceſſarily infers indeed, that that thing has no beginning, according to §. 8. but not ſo, that what has no beginning does therefore exiſt of it ſelf, as is proved §. 24.</p>
            <p n="27">§. 27. And when by §. 22. it is proved, that all Beings, which are in God, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually upheld of God, it follows then, not only that this <hi>continual upholding,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>the Creating</hi> or <hi>Work of Creation</hi> is to be numbred among the Works of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is beyond the power of any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to Create, according to §. 1.2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>But to know <hi>what is properly the Work of Creation,</hi> we muſt examine what the word
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48714:31"/>
               <hi>to Create</hi> does betoken. It is manifeſt from §. 24. that what is eſſential in all things was in God without beginning, ſo that by word <hi>Create</hi> cannot be underſtood, that God ſhould bring forth new Beings, which were not in God without beginning; nor can the Word <hi>Create</hi> ſignify to produce ſomething out of nothing: becauſe to bring forth ſomething out of nothing, preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſomething, the eſſential of which ſhould not have been in God before the Creation, but the contrary of this is proved §. 23.24. Beſides to ſay, that ſomething is produced of nothing, would infer, that the cauſe of the thing produced was a meer Nothing. For to ſay, that the Creation was produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out of Nothing. <hi>viz.</hi> that there was no Matter before the Creation, out of which the World was produced or brought forth, infers not that the World was from nothing. Becauſe the World may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of the Spiritual and inviſible, and not out of a palpable Matter: Beſides, it is a known Truth, that the beginning of all things is the Cauſe thereof; and ſeing they that ſay, that the World was Created out of nothing, do aſſert God to be the Cauſe or Creator of the World, therefore do they alſo thereby contradict themſelves, to with, in that they allow a Cauſe and Beginning of the Creation, and yet deny it to have a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48714:32"/>beginning (of which alſo ſee the Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of B. <hi>Van Helmont Concerning Man,</hi> &amp;c. §. 5.6.</p>
            <p>Whence therefore follows, that <hi>the word Create betokens the bringing forth, or producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſomething, out of the inviſible into open view to be ſeen and perceived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is the Language of the Holy Scripture, For <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. it is ſaid: <hi>We underſtand by faith, that the Worlds were framed by the Word of God, ſo that things which are ſeen, were not made of things that do appear.</hi> But its better rendered thus: <hi>ſo that the things which are ſeen, were made of the things which are not ſeen:</hi> which things that are not ſeen ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.5. are the Waters, where he ſaith, that <hi>the Heavens were of old, and the Earth ſubſisting and ſtanding out of the waters and in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> to wit out of the Heavenly, Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Waters: For theſe are inviſible: ſo that the Waters here below muſt needs have had their riſe from the inviſible Waters above. Of which is largely Treated in the <hi>Conſiderations</hi> of B. <hi>Van Helmont upon Man,</hi> &amp;c. § 7.8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 20. wherefore the Beings of all things, which lay hid in that Spiritual Water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came through the Spirit Viſible in the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, <hi>viz.</hi> in their Out-working. For the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48714:32"/>word <hi>Create</hi> do's not only ſignify the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the Viſible out of the Inviſible,</hi> but alſo, <hi>the putting of the Beings or Spirits into their proper ſtates,</hi> or <hi>the imparting of ſuch qualities, or ſuch capacitie unto them, as gives them a power to work of themſelves.</hi> As for Example, what is Eſſential or Spiritual, as Trees and Plants brings forth Herbs, Trees, Fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The life of Man forms his body, and worketh out many things to his advantage and uſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that <hi>Creation</hi> properly conſiſts herein, that theſe Beings or Spirits which before lay hid, do now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come viſible, and perceptible in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working, by means of that capacity or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which they receive, of uſing the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery Being to their Advantage of Forming, and changing it, (according as it is given to every Spirit or Being to Work) under which watery Being the Earth alſo belongs, becauſe the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was produced out of the Waters (as is ſhewed in <hi>the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of Bar. <hi>Van Helmont upon Man,</hi> &amp;c. §. 7.)</p>
            <p>Moreover, the Holy Scripture does plainly inform us, that the word <hi>Create</hi> does alſo include this Signification, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Eſſentiality or the Spirit of each Creature ſhould work out, according to its properties, the Earthly, where it is ſaid, <hi>in the heginning of the Book of the Creation,</hi> that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48714:33"/>the Earth ſhould bring <hi>forth the Herbs,</hi> and what was to be its out-working? that it <hi>ſhould yield Seed;</hi> in like manner <hi>the working of the Fruit Tree is after his kind to give Fruit, and that in thoſe Fruits ſhould be Seed,</hi> viz. to propogate its like: It is alſo thus ſaid, of the Fiſhes, and Fowles, that their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working ſhould be Fruitfulneſs, and Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; the Fiſhes to fill the waters in the Sea, and the Fowles to multiply in the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And of Man, who is Lord over all the Creatures, it is ſaid, that his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working was, <hi>to be fruitful, and multiply to fill the Earth, and to ſubdue it,</hi> that is, that it ſhould not rule over him, but he have Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over it, and bring it into Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him. <hi>To have Dominion over the Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Sea, and over the Fowles of the Air, and over the Cattel, and over every creeping thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="28">§. 28. But it will be ſaid perhaps, that that place of <hi>Hebrews</hi> 11.3. where it is ſaid: <hi>Through Faith we underſtand that the Worlds were by the Word of God, ſo that things that are ſeen, were not made of things which do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</hi> Or ſo, <hi>That things that are ſeen, were made of things which do not appear;</hi> is not ſo to be underſtood as we have ſaid in the former §. becauſe that manner of ſpeaking of the <hi>Greeks</hi>

            <p>But in anſwer to this Objection, we muſt in the firſt place obſerve, that neither this, nor any other ſuch like manner of Speaking, does any where in the Holy Scripture (that I know of) ſignify, that the World was made of nothing, but the quite contrary; So that to ſay, that this manner of Speech infers, that their Opinion is but their meer ſay ſo, and void of all proof.

            <p>As for the other Objections, that they make from the Holy Scripture to prove that the World was made of nothing, thoſe places will be found, either not to ſpeak at all of the Creation, or if they do, not in the leaſt to prove that the World is Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Nothing. As for Example, ſome alledge <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. to prove that the World was made of nothing, where it is ſaid: <hi>Who quickneth the dead and calleth thoſe things that be not, as tho' they were.</hi> The
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48714:35"/>word in Greek are, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; which properly is: <hi>calling the things which are not, as things that are,</hi> and is not: That God calleth the things that are not, as if they (to wit, the things that are not) were: and ſo he ſpeaketh here of two ſorts of things, of things that are, and of things that are not, and theſe he ſets in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to each other, as in the iſſue ſhall appear.</p>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>God hath Choſen things that are not, to bring to nought things that are.</hi> In this place <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>things that are not</hi> cannot ſignify things that exiſt not; Becauſe the whole Reaſoning of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſhews that he aims at the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: For the intent of the Apoſtle is to exhort the <hi>Corinthians</hi> not to make Sects, and Diviſions, ſuppoſing Wiſdom to conſiſt in a fine quaint Gingle of Words, as may be ſeen <hi>verſe</hi> 10. compared with <hi>verſe</hi> 17. But that the true Wiſdom is ſimple and plain, not gaudy, and therefore ſeems foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs to the Wiſe ones of the Word <hi>v.</hi> 15.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48714:35"/>But theſe wiſe Men are, ſays he, become Vain, and on the contrary, the Wiſdom of God, which the wiſe Men of the World judged fooliſhneſs, is Salvation to them that believe. <hi>v.</hi> 19.20, 21. But in this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the World, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> went aſtray, but to them that were called, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> was given the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, <hi>v.</hi> 24. and theſe called ones, are not wiſe Men according to the Fleſh, but were eſteemed as fooliſh and weak, <hi>v.</hi> 25.26, 27. <hi>Yet theſe Baſe and Deſpiſed ones it was that God choſe to confound and bring to nought the wiſe ones: yea the baſe and theſe which are not,</hi> that is them which have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Wiſdom, Honour nor Riches, of the World, (as may be ſeen from <hi>v.</hi> 26.) <hi>hath God choſen,</hi> and on the contrary, <hi>the wiſe Men of the World, <hi>Which are,</hi>
               </hi> that is, who are eſteemed Wiſe, Noble, Mighty, <hi>&amp;c. he bringeth to nought.</hi> From which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenation is as plain as the Sun, that the Apoſtle in this place does not mean <hi>the things which are not</hi> in Being, but ſuch things as are deſpiſed by the World: For the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks here of two ſorts, which are both in Being, to wit, the wiſe Men of the World, and the fooliſh of the World, and of theſe he ſays, that they are choſen, and the other confounded, and brought to nought. From hence then the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48714:36"/>
               <hi>v.</hi> 29.30, 31. and ſhews <hi>that no fleſh</hi> that is neither Worldly wiſe, which are, nor fooliſh, which are not, may boaſt, but in God alone, and not in the World. And if we will thus Examine the Argument of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. we ſhall find that the words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> have the like ſignification as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. For as the Apoſtle had there ſaid, that both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction were called of God, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe of them that ſought not after the Wiſdom of the World; the ſcope of the Apoſtles is to ſhew <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as the <hi>Jews</hi> are juſtified by Faith, and not by the Works of the Law, or carnal Wiſdom, as may be ſeen <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.28, 29, 30, 31. whereupon the Apoſtle then <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.1. proves by a Queſtion, that they, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> were not juſtified by their Works, nor have any more priviledge thereby than the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> the reaſon is, becauſe their Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> obtained nothing after the fleſh, to wit, by which he acquired his own Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; that <hi>Abraham</hi> ganied nothing after the Fleſh, the Apoſtle ſhews from the 2. to the 9. <hi>verſes.</hi> For if <hi>Abraham</hi> be juſtified by works ſaith he, then is God obliged to reward him, and then is <hi>Abrahams</hi> righteouſneſs not of Grace: But this, O ye <hi>Jews!</hi> is moſt certain, according to the Teſtimony of Holy Writ, that <hi>Abraham</hi> is juſtifyed by Faith and not by Works, and that thoſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48714:36"/>only do obtain Salvation, to whom God gives it of Grace, and not according to their own Merits; wherefore ye <hi>Jews</hi> by being the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> after the Fleſh, have no Prerogative above the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that you can be juſtified by the works of the Law. And to ſhew you, that the Works of the Law can give you no more Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> let us ſee when it was that God juſtified <hi>Abraham, viz.</hi> before he received the Law of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> or after? <hi>v.</hi> 9. God pronounced him happy before his Circumciſion, that is, while he was yet a <hi>Gentile. v.</hi> 10. And the Law of <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</hi> was unto him but a Sign that he was juſtified by Faith, while he was yet a <hi>Gentile, v.</hi> 11. Wherefore ye <hi>Jews</hi> go aſtray from the way, and your boaſting is vain, that ye are Circumciſed, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, and that ye can attain unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by that; for your Father <hi>Abraham</hi> was not juſtified by <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> but before it, and conſequently altho' the <hi>Gentiles</hi> be Uncircumciſed, they are not therefore a whit below you, but as well Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> as you, if they walk in Father <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> Faith; becauſe they being Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed believe as he being Uncircumciſed believed. For the promiſe that he ſhould in his Seed poſſeſs the World, was not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him by the Law of Works, or of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48714:37"/>but by Faith, and therefore all that Believe are Children of <hi>Abraham. v.</hi> 11.12, 13. Let us moreover ſee, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye <hi>Jews</hi> have any more Prerogative then the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> from the Nature of the Law it ſelf, to obtain thereby Salvation. But if you be Heirs by the Law of Works, you have then no need of Faith, and you know that you cannot fulfil the Law per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly; but that you do tranſgreſs it, and conſequently cannot thereby receive any reward, but puniſhment and wrath; and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are not puniſhable, becauſe the Law was not given to them; ſo that the Law is your Burthen, and not that you ſhould thereby be juſtified, &amp; ſo your Boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the works of the Law in vain becauſe the Law cannot give Salvation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> muſt receive Salvation of Grace; and thus all Believers are Children of the believing <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the Argument runs, <hi>v.</hi> 14.15, 16.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid: How can the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> poſſibly become the Children of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle Anſwers this Objection, <hi>v.</hi> 17. and ſhews, that that God that ſet <hi>Abraham</hi> for a Father of many Nations, is able even to cauſe the dead to live; and how does he this? thus, <hi>Only by calling the things which are not, as the things which are;</hi> that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48714:37"/>is, he commands; and it is as eaſie to God, <hi>to raiſe the dead, which are not as the things which are:</hi> that is, to ſhew his Grace to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which are dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes, and no Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as it is for him to call or ſhew his Grace to them <hi>which are,</hi> to wit, which are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of <hi>Abraham</hi> after the Fleſh: For it is very eaſie to underſtand from the Context and Threed of the Apoſtles reaſoning, that the Apoſtle here oppoſes the <hi>Jews</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and calls the <hi>Jews</hi> them <hi>which are,</hi> to wit, the People of God, or <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children; and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> them <hi>which are not, i. e.</hi> which were neither the People of God, nor the Children of <hi>Abraham;</hi> but dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes; ſo that this place is Synonymous to that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.

               </gap> ſignifies to be <hi>forgotten, deſpiſed, dead,</hi> &amp;c. Now, what is dead cannot be ſaid, <hi>not to be at all,</hi> becauſe that which <hi>is not,</hi> cannot have been living; or have been any thing in former time.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48714:38"/>From all which then it appears very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and beyond all contradiction, that there is not the leaſt proof in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. that the world was made of nothing.</p>
            <p n="29">§. 29. But to return to the former Matter, we muſt not only conſider, what the word <hi>Create</hi> betokens, but alſo what belongs to the Work of Creation.</p>
            <p n="30">§. 30. For as much then as this moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Being cannot admit of the leaſt defect, becauſe it is unchangeably perfect, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows neceſſarily, that this Being is <hi>perfectly wiſe,</hi> and conſequently works all <hi>things or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and wiſely,</hi> that is, that in the Work of Creation, there is neither too little nor too much: but juſt ſo much as is neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to that work, that is, that in every thing there is an appointed number and meaſure, and each has his own life, by which it can effect the work whereunto it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: For if God ſhould make any work defective, it would be produced diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, irregularly, and unwiſely, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently God would want that perfect wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, of making a thing that is perfect in its Kind: And for much as this can in no wiſe be admitted to be in the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Being, according to §. 10.11. there
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48714:38"/>cannot be in any of the works of God any thing either ſuperfluous of defective.</p>
            <p n="31">§. 31. But albeit God is always doing the ſame thing, according to §. 21. yet it does not hence follow, that God cannot have Created more than one World, but that God doth continually Create, that is, that he never ceaſes Creating of Worlds. Becauſe the Word <hi>Creation</hi> includes all that belongs thereunto; as for Example, to the Creation of the World do belong all thoſe things, which have already wrought out what is Viſible, which are at preſent wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Viſibly, or which ſhall hereafter ſo work, becauſe the one is a Creature of this World, as well as the other: in ſhort, <hi>The Creation conſiſts in all thoſe things which do operate together, and are inſeparably united to each other, as one only Creature.</hi> Thus the whole World, with all that therein is, ſtands in ſuch a Co-operation, as daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience does ſufficiently teach us.</p>
            <p n="32">§. 32. And for as much as all that hath ever had, or ever ſhall have an out-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in included in the Creation, <hi>It muſt needs be, that thoſe things which in proceſs of time did firſt begin to come to view, were yet Created in the firſt of the Creation, and were not then firſt Created, when they firſt did appear.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:48714:39"/>
            <p>For if they began then to be Created, when they became firſt <hi>Viſible,</hi> it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that this World is yet daily in Creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is, that there are daily new things added to it, which were not included in the Creation, <hi>i. e.</hi> when God brought forth this Viſible or Tangible World. Now if there be daily new things Created in this World, which were not in it when it was Produced, it is certain <hi>That thoſe things that are now Created, either belong to this World, or they do not.</hi> If the Beings that now are Created, belong not unto this World, they have no fellowſhip, nor co-operation with this World, and ſo concern not us, Becauſe we only treat here of thoſe Beings, which belong to this World. And if they do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to this world, then this world was made inperfectly or defectuouſly by God, that is, there was a defect in the work of God, when he brought forth this World, which afterwards was amended from time to time, by ſupplying of that Original de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which is contrary to §. 21. where it is proved, that it's impoſible that there ſhould be any defect in Gods Works.</p>
            <p>It would alſo be inconſiſtent with the wiſdom of God, (of which ſee §. 30.) which admits not of the leaſt imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or defect in his work; becauſe Wiſdom requires that nothing be omitted that is neceſſary to a thing. As for Example, a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48714:39"/>wiſe and prudent Architect or Maſter-Builder, will bring into his Building all things that he judges neceſſary thereunto; and if one of theſe be found wanting, when the Building is finiſhing, it will be no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Wiſdom, but of folly in the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he did not, while he was build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, introduce all things, which he judged neceſſary thereunto. If then this neglect be an effect of Ignorance in Man, how can ſuch a thing then ever come to paſs in the moſt wiſe Being to Create a World that ſhould want ſomething, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards neceſſary or fit to be Created? this is ſo directly contrary to the wiſdom and perfection of God, that he ſhould produce a work which is not every way perfect that a more abuſurd thing cannot well be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned contrary to the wiſdom of God then to ſay: that there were fewer Beings Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in this World at firſt then to this world did belong.</p>
            <p>Now what reaſon can any man alledge, why God ſhould not Create that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to this world at once? Did God want Power at the Creation, any more than now? ſurely no, For God is <hi>Almighty;</hi> according to §. 17. Did God not then as well as now, know what was needful to this world? Verily yes, as is ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved §. 15. To what purpoſe then do theſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48714:40"/>men ſay, that God yet daily Creates things in this world.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that the things that are now daily Created, do appertain to this world, then it is certain that they are a part of this world: If they be a part of it, then they are not now firſt Created, but were at firſt Created altogether with the world in its firſt production: For conſidering the world as one entire Piece of Wormanſhip, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to be Created unleſs all the parts thereof together with it be Created: As for Example: this is a conſtant Truth, that the whole conſiſts in its parts, and that all the parts do make out the whole, and that if but one of the Parts be wanting, the whole is defective, or it is no more the whole: So alſo this World conſiſting of all its parts, and all the parts thereof ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up the world, the world cannot to this day be ſaid to be Created, becauſe there are (according to this Hypotheſis) dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly new parts thereof Created, but then there would at the Creation have only been ſome parts of the world Created, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the world would then not have been a whole or compleat world at the time of its Creation, but only a piece of a world.</p>
            <p>It's alſo contrary to the Holy Scripture, that there ſhould ſtill daily be things Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48714:40"/>in this World, For <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid, <hi>And God ſaw all that he had made, and behold it was very Good;</hi> that is, it was in a State fit to obtain that which God aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at thereby: Now this is certain, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be good, with reſpect to God, but that which has all the qualifications requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit thereunto: Now if all thoſe Beings which are requiſit to the Work of this Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation were not then in Being, then what God aimed at in the Creation could not be effected or accompliſhed by it, becauſe the Creation would then have been defective, and thoſe Parts which were to co-operate in the Creation, would have been wanting therein: and ſo according to theſe Mens Hypotheſis, it cannot be ſaid, that all that God made was very good. Again it is ſaid <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Thus the Heavens and the Earth were finiſhed and all the Hoſt of them.</hi> When it is here ſaid that they were <hi>Finiſhed</hi> or <hi>Perfected,</hi> (that is) they were ſo brought to an end and accompliſht, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now a wanting, (for this is the proper ſenſe of the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Kalah</hi> to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) even all the Hoſt of the Heavens and the Earth, that is all the Beings that to this world do appertain: for here 'tis not ſaid <hi>[an]</hi> or one Hoſt of them, <hi>but all the Hoſts of them were finiſhed.</hi> How can it then be ſaid that there are daily new Beings Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48714:41"/>in this world? This is not only to ſet Divine Attributes at odds, but alſo openly to contradict the Holy Scripture. And to diſcover further the abſurdity of this Hypotheſis, to wit, that new Beings are daily Created in this World; we muſt here conſider, what is ſaid in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.2. Now when it is ſaid, <hi>That on the ſeventh day God ended his work, which he had made;</hi> No man is ſo blind, but he ſees, that by the word <hi>[Work]</hi> here, is meant the work of the Creation, when it is then ſaid here, that the work of this Creation is <hi>Finiſhed</hi> or <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and that God reſted from the Work of the Creation,</hi> that is, that God added no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more unto this world; For what elſe can <hi>reſting</hi> ſignify here, ſeing God is never weary, yea is continually working, according to §. 20. is it not then moſt true, that there are no new Beings every day Created, but that they were all Created together in the Creation at once?</p>
            <p>But it will be poſſibly ſaid, when God Created the World, he did indeed Create all thoſe ſorts of Beings that were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to it, ſo that he now Creates no new ſorts of Beings, but ſuch ſorts as were at firſt Created in the Creation.</p>
            <p>A fine Invention indeed! and which is pretty ſubtile, that they may ſeem to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſomething. But let us ſee of what
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48714:41"/>force it is. To theſe that ſay that all the Species of Beings that now are in the World, were indeed at the Creation, but that God now ſtill Creates of the ſame Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies daily, as were then Created; to them I ſay, and ask, whether God does not cauſe them of thoſe ſorts or Species, which they ſay, he now Creates, to be produced out of thoſe which were in Being at the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation? Daily experience teaches us this, that no Creature is produced, but by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of its like; or from ſuch things as are fit to bring forth; as for Example, out of the Earth, Plants, Trees, and Fleſh we ſee Inſects come forth, ſo that the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial of thoſe Inſects was before hid in that, which brought them forth; for it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and contrary to the whole frame of Nature, that any thing can be born of any other thing, if the Birth were not hid in the Producer: ſeing then that all things that are now Born, do come forth of thoſe things that were in the Creation, it is moſt certain, that the Eſſences of all things, that do now appear, or that ever ſhall appear, were at once Created together with the World, and are not now firſt Created; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Creation is a work immediatly produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by God, and Generation is nothing elſe but the Creatures bringing forth of that which for a time was hid in them.</hi> And ſince that nothing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48714:42"/>is now produced in this World but by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, it cannot be ſaid, that God doth yet daily Create things in this World. They, that would prove, that God does daily Create Beings, that were not at the Creation of the World, muſt prove, that they ever found any Creature that was not produced either out of the Earth, or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſuch like, which is impoſſible; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the whole courſe of Nature ſhews the contrary.</p>
            <p>Therefore, thoſe that ſay that God does yet every day Create things in this World, they confound the Work of Generation with that of Creation, and do miſtake the one for the other. Once more, if God did ſtill Create Beings in this World, that were not at once Created in the Creation, why ſhould God have bleſſed them? <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. with the bleſſing of Fertility and Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? That is, of Generation with their like? That Bleſſing would verily not have been true, becauſe according to them, God does ſtill daily Create the beings of things, and ſo Generation would have no place; the contrary of which yet is daily ſeen; to wit, that the Creatures do Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their like, and not that they are Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated: And when it is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.3. <hi>And God bleſſed the</hi> 7th. <hi>day and Sanctifyed it; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in it he reſted from all his Work,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48714:42"/>God had Created and made.</hi> What ſenſe can there be (if we ſtill aſſert, that God doth yet daily Create in this World) of theſe words: <hi>Becauſe that in it God reſted,</hi> that is <hi>becauſe he ceaſed from the work of Creation on the</hi> 7th. <hi>day, therefore he bleſſed and ſanctified it?</hi> Were then the other following days not alſo Bleſſed and Sanctified? Verily there is no reaſon, why we ſhould not eſteem them equal with the Seventh Day; nor does the Scripture exclude them: If then this Bleſſing extends it ſelf to all the other following dayes, then God does not yet daily Create in this World: becauſe there would then be a contradiction in the Reaſon; why God bleſſed the 7th. day; under which are included the following days, to wit, becauſe he reſted from Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the 7th. day; but if God ſhould ſtill Create after the 7th. day, to what purpoſe then ſhould this Bleſſing and Sanctification be? Or if they ſay, that the 7th. day is Holyer than the reſt; becauſe God did then reſt from the Work of Creating: I then ask theſe men, whether it be their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that God never Creates in this World upon the 7th. day? As alſo, whether God does not as well reſt upon the other dayes, when he has Created a new Being in this World? For we find by Experience, that all men are not Born upon one and the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48714:43"/>ſame day, but that upon all the ſeven days men are Born in this World, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently (according to the Modern com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opinion) that God Creates Spirits upon all days without diſtinction: what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can there then be, if God Creates upon the Fourth and Fifth day a Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then ceaſeth, why ſhould he not bleſs the Fourth or Fifth days as well as the Seventh day, ſeing that he reſteth on it, as well as on the Seventh day? But to paſs by all further diſputes, the ſenſe of theſe Words cannot without contradiction ſignify any thing elſe, but that <hi>God ceaſing upon the ſeventh day from the work of Creation, or reſting from it; bleſſed that day,</hi> to wit, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Creatures from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Multiply, and ſo <hi>ſanctified it,</hi> that is, ſet it apart from the time of Creation, as not appertaining thereunto; and to what purpoſe, I pray did God bleſs and Sanctify that day? As the <hi>Dutch</hi> Bible has it, it was <hi>to perfect,</hi> or <hi>throughly to finiſh all:</hi> to wit, that the Creatures might now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to Work, but that which God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them in the Creation to work forth, <hi>viz.</hi> That they ſhould be Fruitful and Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſeing then that God hath ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, or ſet apart the Seventh day, from the days of the Creation (for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Kadaſh</hi> properly ſignifys nothing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48714:43"/>elſe, but to ſet a thing ſo apart, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs no more to that whereunto it did at firſt appertain) it muſt needs follow, that God Creates no more in this world, or elſe that would be no reaſon, why God ſhould have Sanctified the 7th. day more then any other day.</p>
            <p>Furthermore the work <hi>Create,</hi> is not any where in the Holy Scripture, that I know of, uſed concerning things that are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Generation, nor is it the modern way of Speech, to ſay, this day a man is Created, but born.</p>
            <p>But ſome will perhaps ask: If God Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated all things that belong to this World, in the beginning of the Creation, why were not all things that to this World belong, made viſible at firſt in the Creation; as for Example: wherefore did not God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſo many Men, Beaſts, Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at the beginning of the Creation, as were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to this World?</p>
            <p>In anſwer, that true it is, that if we do only look at the power of God, we might be apt to think, that all the Creatures might have been made viſible at the beginning of the Creation at once, but ſeing we cannot conſider the Almightineſs of God without his other Attributes, theſe muſt be ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that they do agree in one; Now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more certain, than that there is, in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48714:44"/>the <hi>Almightineſs, Freewill,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of God a Wiſdom</hi> according to §. 22. and 30. that is to ſay, that God does nothing but in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and not confuſedly: and ſeing we find every day by all Creatures, how wiſely, exactly, and Orderly all things do proceed, the one out of the other in their Seaſons, that all things ſhould not be brought forth at once, and at the ſame time, but in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time. And conſequently the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to that Queſtion; Why did not God make all things viſible in the Creation? is this, to wit, That God according to his own Wiſdom, and the Order which he keeps in all things, has ſo Created all things in this World, that the one Creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hid in the other, each is in its appointed Seaſon to come forth out of the other, and not altogether at once.</p>
            <p>But it will perhaps be yet further ſaid, in oppoſition to this Doctrine, that all things were indeed Created in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Creation, and that now there are no more new Beings Created in this World, That the Bodies are indeed gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the Parents, but that God Creates the Spirit, and conſequently, that it does not follow, that God Created all that which to this World belongs in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of its Creation.</p>
            <p>But becauſe this Objection is of great
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48714:44"/>conſequence, and properly belongs to the birth of Man, therefore we will anſwer it in that place, where we treat of the Soul.</p>
            <p n="33">§. 33. For as much then as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved more than ſufficiently, that all thoſe things, which do at any time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in this World, were in the beginning at the Creation; It is likewiſe certain, <hi>that every Creature has received a particular own or proper working, or capacity to Work out thoſe things, which the Creator has appointed it to work out:</hi> For if the Creature had no <hi>own working,</hi> that is, if God had not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to his Creature a capacity or power to work out ſomething of its ſelf, what wiſdom would there be in the Creation, and what profit would it be to the Creature to be created? Verily none at all; becauſe then the Creature would be nothing elſe, but a meer Inſtrument that can Work nothing, except the Workman does perpetually move it, and then no Creature could be ſaid to do any thing, but only God the Creator might be ſaid to work, and not the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Now if this were ſo, there would be no Wiſdom in the Creation, becauſe all the Creatures being void of all capacity of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themſelves, and all that they do, being nothing elſe but Gods working, the Creatures could be of no uſe, or ſervice
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48714:45"/>at all, and as meer nothings, and God would only be ſaid to ſhew <hi>unto himſelf</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter how many ſorts of ways he could work: juſt as one, that playing with Puppets, ſhews unto himſelf, how many ſorts of motions he can make with them, while the Images or Puppets themſelves have nothing at all of it, but he alone that moves them to and fro; which manner of doing is no way conſiſtent with the Wiſdom of God, being a meer Puppit Play of Children that would be of no uſe or ſervice, but God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly playing with himſelf; a conceit moſt diſhonourable to the Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God.</p>
            <p>But beſides the Holy Scripture does moſt evidently ſhew, that God produced the Creature, to that very end, that it might have an own out-working; for <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.6. it is ſaid, <hi>that the firmament of Heavens was made, to make a diviſion betwixt the Waters which are above, and the waters which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath.</hi> and V. 11. <hi>That the Earth was made to bring forth Graſs, the Herb, Trees,</hi> &amp;c. and V. 14. <hi>The Lights to divide the day from the Night; for Signs and for Seaſons, and for Days and Years,</hi> &amp;c. V. 20. <hi>The Waters to bring forth Fiſh.</hi> V. 21. <hi>The Fiſhes, the Fowls to be fruitful and to Multiply,</hi> and ſo forth to the end of the Chapter, as has been ſhewed already. § 27.</p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:48714:45"/>
            <p>Moreover if a Man will but examine himſelf, he ſhall find that he has his own Working, becauſe he has the Power of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or forbearing of many things, in ſo much as he is Maſter of that, which he has a mind to do, or not to do: But when he is once become a Slave to that which once he could have done, or could have forborn is under a neceſſity of following the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that thing to which he is obedient: As for Example, a Man that is ſubject to Drunkenneſs, as long as that deſire or luſt rules over him he loves it; whreas on the contrary, another that is not addicted to Drinking, can do it, or forbear it, as he pleaſes, <hi>and in this his good liking, or Free-will it is, that the own-working of Me conſists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 'tis moſt neceſſary, that man be Created with a Free-will, becauſe elſe he would not be able to work any thing out, but only to obey that which ſhould be acted in him juſt as a Watch, which is moved by the Laws of Mechaniſm; which is moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtant with the Divine Wiſdom, that a man (as we have juſt now ſaid) ſhould have no own-working or free-will, that is, ſo far forth as to be able thereby to direct thoſe Powers which God has Created in him, as he pleaſeth; but not that his free-will ſhould extend it ſelf to things out of his Power.</p>
            <pb n="76" facs="tcp:48714:46"/>
            <p>And becauſe God is a juſt and Merciful God, who puniſhes the Sinner for his Sins, and on the Contrary gives his Grace, or ſhews Mercy to him, that does well, the Creature muſt needs have an own Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: or elſe wherefore or how ſhould God either puniſh, or ſhew Mercy to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Verily the Creature would be blameleſs, and uncapable either of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or of Mercy, becauſe it would be but as an Inſtrument which is moved by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo neither the Juſtice nor the Mercy of God could have any place in the Creature.</p>
            <p>Nor would man ſtand either in fear of Puniſhment, or hopes of reward, if he had no own-working, becauſe he could never be conſcious to himſelf of having done either Good or evil; becauſe he ſhould not be the cauſe of either, but would only have followed the will of his Maſter: And then Man would not have any Conſcience of any thing he does, (the contrary where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of every man finds in himſelf) becauſe, to be conſcious to our ſelves of a thing is, to know that one has been the Author of it, and done it voluntarily.</p>
            <p>From all which then follows, that the Creatures have received from God in their Creation a capacity of working of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:48714:46"/>
            <p n="34">§. 34. But it will be ſaid again, ſeing that God is (according to §. 16.) the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all things, it follows that God muſt be the Author of all the Works which the Creature does, and therefore that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can have no own-working nor free-will.</p>
            <p>As to this Objection, if duly weighed, we ſhall find, that it affects not our proof; for we ſay: that God muſt needs have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Creature in its Creation, the power which it has of working of it ſelf, from whence then evidently follows, that we do eſtabliſh it for a certain truth, that God is ſo the Author of the Creature, and all his works, that if he withdraws this capacity of working from the Creature, the Creature can work no more, but this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Matter in hand. But the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion here is properly: Whether the Creature ſo long as it is by God preſerved in its State, has not an Own-working? Or to ſpeak plainer: Whether God who is the Author of the Creature, has not given unto the Creature a Power of Working ſomething out of it ſelf, by vertue of that capacity which God hath given him in the Creation? As for Example, God is the Author of all our Working, but yet he has given man the capacity, <hi>that he can direct that Working power, which he has according to</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:48714:47"/>
               <hi>his own good liking, and this direction is the proper work of Man:</hi> And ſo far forth as man does thus manage it, God is not ſaid to do it: but man: ſo that as to this manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is an own-working of man, and it proceeds from that capacity and free-will, that God gave him in the Creation.</p>
            <p>But if we did mean by own-working, that the Creature could do any thing that did not proceed from that ability which God has given the Creature, but which ſhould proceed from ſomething elſe, forreign to that principle, which God has placed in the Creature; then their concluſion would be right juſt againſt us: to wit, that the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature cannot have any own-working, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is the Original of all things. But becauſe we affirm that that own-working o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Creature proceeds from God, as the cauſe and Author of all things, therefore in this reſpect, the Objection cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our Poſition.</p>
            <p>But ſome will perhaps ſay, If the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture man has no own-working from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which does not flow from that Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which God hath placed in him, then i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> will follow, that truly and properly ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> does not ſin, but that ſin proceeds from that capacity which God has given the Creature and that if it does not proceed from tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> capacity, then the work of ſinning is man
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48714:47"/>own-work, which proceeds not from the Author of his Being.</p>
            <p>But this Objection ariſes from want of knowing what the own-working of man, and what Sin properly is, and wherein they do conſiſt. It is already ſaid, that all working of the Creatures does proceed from that capacity, which God has placed in the Creature, and conſequently that God is the Original of all our Working: But albeit all our works have their Original from God, yet God has given Man that ability in the Creation, that he can direct thoſe Works according to his own good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking, or as he thinks beſt; that is in ſhort, God gave man in his Creation <hi>free-will</hi> (as is already ſhewed) according to which he can do or forbear things; and <hi>this <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will</hi> is properly tha capacity which man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God in the Creation, and when man does any thing according to his Free-will, that is called Mans-work.</hi> It is indeed true that the working ſo far as it is eſſential, (and all our Works are ſo) has its Original from God, but the direction of that Working comes from Man himſelf, and is ſo far forth called an own-working of Man; as for example, as to the action (or working) of going, ſpeaking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God is the Author of it, but ſo far as Man directs his Steps, Speech, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> either to good or evil, ſo far
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48714:48"/>is it an own-working of Man; and becauſe the evil properly conſiſts in the direction of the Works, or action, and not in the Work or action it ſelf, it does not at all follow, that ſin muſt have its Original from God, becauſe God is the Original of all the works of Man, for that the direction of the working depends upon the Free-will of man, but not the working it ſelf. So that it neither follows, that man muſt needs have ſuch an own-working, as takes its Original from himſelf, and not from God; nor on the contrary, that God, becauſe he is the Original of all working, muſt needs alſo be the cauſe and Author of Sin; becauſe working conſidered in it ſelf, is good: but man having a Free-will, directs it to evil, and ſo as to that direction it is (in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect) ſaid to be evil and an own-working or act of man: and ſo in this Objection the working, and the direction of the working are confounded together, which yet, as has been ſaid, are diſtinct.</p>
            <p>Beſides, when it is ſaid, that the Work of Sin is an own-work of Man, here again, the Sin and the working are confounded, taking the working and the ſin to be the ſame thing, becauſe they are not able to diſtinguiſh the ſin from the working.</p>
            <p>But to underſtand this diſtinctly, we muſt examine <hi>what Sin properly is, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48714:48"/>it does conſiſt: Sin</hi> then <hi>conſiſts properly herein, that man directs the Working, which he has to ſomething elſe than that to which it ought to be uſed.</hi> So that the Sin lyes not in the working, in the Act, Action, Work, or Deed it ſelf, but in the direction that man has over the Working: as for Example, a Carpenter is about to uſe an Ax to cleave a piece of Wood, ſo to do is good and well, becauſe it tends to the good of Man; but if he uſes the Ax to kill a Man, that is evil. Now that is certain that the uſing of the Ax is as well a working in the one, as in the other caſe, and as to theſe two work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, conſidered in themſelves, the one is no more evil than the other, becauſe they are ſo far, of one and the ſame nature: But if we conſider the directions of thoſe two Workings, we ſhall find them to differ ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much from each other; to wit, that the one is profitable and the other miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous; whence then we may clearly ſee, that ſin is no working but a wrong directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the working; and that Sin lyes in that wrong direction, we ſhall very plainly obſerve from the names, that Sin bears in the Holy Scripture, as in <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which is a <hi>departing from the true way,</hi> or evil direction, as appears from <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.2. <hi>He that haſteth with his feet ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth;</hi> that is, he that directs his Feet
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48714:49"/>wrong ſinneth. So alſo in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies a departure from the right way, which conſiſts in the wrong direction that men obſerve.</p>
            <p n="35">§. 35. Seing then that man hath an own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working-power or Facutly to direct his doings, according to his own good liking, it is moſt neceſſary, <hi>that the moſt perfect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould reward a man according to the works which he hath done:</hi> For if a man did not receive Reward according to his Works, what advantage or profit would a Man have of his doings? Verily none at all, and ſo it would be all one what he did, which yet would be moſt contrary to the Nature of Man: For nothing is more natural to him, than to expect a reward according to his Deeds. And for this cauſe it is, that he is preſently conſcious to himſelf of the Good or Evil that he does, which conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs would be in vain if there were no reward for him to be expected.</p>
            <p>It would in like manner be moſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the nature of the Divine Being, not to reward Man according to his Works, becauſe man could then not do amiſs in any thing he ſhould do, whether he did things contrary to God, or agreeable to Gods Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, becauſe where there is no reward, there is no miſdeed or tranſgreſſion, (for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48714:49"/>theſe are things that do neceſſarily infer each other) and where there is no Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, there can be no Law or Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to do the contrary, and conſequently what ever a Man did, would be good, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrary to, or agreeable with Gods Perfections: Becauſe he would then have no Law either for the doing or forbearing of it. Now it is moſt certain, that it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to a reaſonable worldly Prince, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his Subjects according to their deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits when they tranſgreſs againſt him, and on the contrary, to reward them that do well. How much more then muſt this be natural to the moſt perfect Being, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thoſe that Tranſgreſs againſt him, and on the contrary to reward them that do well. Yea if God did not puniſh them that Tranſgreſs againſt him, He ſhould never obtain his end in making them, that is, that they ſhould work out the good unto which they were Created, but they would more and more deviate from the Good; unto which good they muſt be brought back, by means of Puniſhment. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe God cannot be Glorified by them; and conſequently becauſe God will be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by Man, he muſt bring him back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain when he is become evil, into that ſtate in which he can glorify God; Now this amendment cannot be effected but
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48714:50"/>by means of puniſhment, and death, by which the Creatures do come into a better condition; As is proved in the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Bar. <hi>Van He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mont upon Man,</hi> &amp;c. §. 32.</p>
            <p>Yea it would be confuſion in God, to eſteem two things ſo directly contrary to each other, as alike good and worthy, and to reward the one juſt as the other, which confuſion can have no place in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is a God of Order, according to §. 30.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it muſt needs be, that God is not only good, but alſo <hi>juſt,</hi> that is, that he rewards every one according to his works.</p>
            <p n="36">§. 36. Now for as much as Gods Juſtice includes the rewarding of every one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Works, it follows, that God does reward or puniſh all them which have done the ſame things after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; for <hi>Juſtice</hi> being nothing elſe but a reward or puniſhment proportion'd to the work, therefore not the Perſon but the Deed is conſidered, and becauſe the Deed is ſtill the ſame, and cannot be ſaid to be better or worſe in it ſelf, whoever it be that does it, hence follows neceſſarily that God cannot reward or puniſh one man more then another, when they have done one
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48714:50"/>and the ſame thing, becauſe it would be partial, and conſequently an imperfection, which is contrary to §. 11. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, If a Judge having two Criminals before him, that had committed the ſame Crime, ſhould puniſh one with death, and clear the other, that would be no Juſtice, but the higheſt injuſtice, unequal, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, becauſe Juſtice requires, that the ſame things, or things of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhould be rewarded or puniſhed in the ſame wiſe.</p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay, The Juſtice of this world indeed requires the ſame puniſhment of the ſame Crimes, but God who is the Author of Man, has that power according to his free and unlimited Will, that he can puniſh the one, and let the other go free, although they have both committed the ſame Sins.</p>
            <p>But ſeing it is unreaſonable in man, to puniſh the one and to let go the other, how much more unreaſonable then would it be in the moſt Perfect Being, who is Reaſon it ſelf, to do a thing ſo much againſt all Reaſon and Equity, as to let the one go free and to puniſh the other? ſuppoſing them equally guilty.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if we ſhould affirm this to be a Prerogative of the Free-will of God, that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48714:51"/>he can puniſh the one, and let the other go free, we ſhould ſet up a Free-will in God, that is unjuſt. Which would be as much as to ſay, that God is both reaſonable and unreaſonable; whereas the Free-will in God, is nothing elſe but Gods doing all things wiſely, and reaſonably according to the Order by himſelf eſtabliſht; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that deviſe ſuch a Free-will in God, do invent to themſelves a God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own fancies: Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods Free-will, and how we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, we have ſpoken at large already in §. 22.</p>

               <p>NOthing can more heartily affect a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soul, than to conſider what a Sinner is, in order to his coming back again to the ſtate of Rectitude, in which he was before he gave himſelf up to his fleſh, and to the evil Luſt thereof, by which his underſtanding, which was perfectly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by the Rays of the Divine Light, became wholly darkned, yea darkneſs it ſelf: Verily no man, which ever felt the leaſt Glimps of that Divine Light in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, cannot lament any thing more than his corrupted Nature, and that he cannot by reaſon of his darkneſs, ſearch out the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48714:52"/>hidden Wiſdom of God, but very lamely, and therefore will daily and continually ſigh, and from his moſt inward parts, call upon his God, that he may receive an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned underſtanding, that Chriſt the Son of Righteouſneſs may be formed in him, that ſo the Image of God, aceording to which he was Created, may be reſtored in him, and his Soul and Body be ſtirred up to repentance.</p>
               <p>And as the Wiſdom of God has not in vain made known to Man the firſt State in which he was brought forth by his Creator, as alſo his Fall, but has moſt expreſly ſhewed the Sinner, what Glory man had in the State of rectitude, and how it is darkned by Sin: So it is, in my judgement, a matter of great conſequence for one that loves God, firſt to examine what parts do neceſſarily belong unto a truly Godly and Perfect Man, before he examines how he can pleaſe God: for he that does not know what is required to be a Believer, will ſeek he knows not what; Juſt as a Traveller, who travelling towards a place, if he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knows the way to it, nor the place, nor where it lyes, nor inquires after it, will always be uncertain whither he ſhall come at laſt.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we ſhall follow the Order
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48714:52"/>which God obſerves in the Creation, and enquire

               <p n="37">§. 37. Seing then, that Man is ſo fallen from his firſt State, that by reaſon of his darkned underſtanding, he does not ſo much as know of what parts a Perfect Man conſiſts, there is no other way to come to know the Parts of a Perfect Man but one of theſe two, either that God ſhould reveal it to Man immediatly by his Spirit, or that God ſhould teach him it by means of the Holy Scripture. Therefore, he that will by his Natural underſtanding go about to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what properly belongs to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man, ſhall never know nor compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it; becauſe he wants that part of man which properly makes a perfect Man.</p>
               <p n="38">§. 38. He that ſhall read the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with attention, will find that they ſpeak of three Beings in Man: to wit, of <hi>the Image or Spirit of God;</hi> of <hi>the Soul,</hi> and of <hi>the Body.</hi> Thus is Man deſcribed in the Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26, 27. <hi>God Created man in his own Image,</hi> ſo that man had in him
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48714:53"/>the Images of God, and <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. it is ſaid, <hi>That man was formed of the duſt of the Earth, and that the Breath of Life was breathed into his Noſtrils, and that he became a living Soul.</hi> So that the perfect man conſiſts <hi>in the Image of God, in a Soul, and in a Body;</hi> which three diſtinct Beings the Apoſtle does alſo mention, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. <hi>The very God of Peace Sanctify you wholly, and I pray God your whole Spirit, Soul and Body be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved blameleſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="39">§. 39. They then who have at any time taſted of the goodneſs of God, who have felt the true light, and <hi>are renewed in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge after the Image of him that Created them, Col.</hi> 3.10. ſuch I ſay, will acknowledge, that the perfect man conſiſts not only in Soul and Body, but alſo in Spirit, becauſe they feel in themſelves a Spirit of Wiſdom, which makes known unto them in their moſt inward parts, the Divine Myſteries and Vertues, not by Ratiocination but by manner of Influence and Manifeſtation, or inſtruction, yea they ſhall on the contrary perceive, that if they attempt to meaſure the Workds of God by their natural Reaſon, that they are at a loſs in themſelves, and do not underſtand any thing at all of the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, for which cauſe they do by their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Supplications continually deſire to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48714:53"/>be enlightened, making no eſteem or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their humane Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>They then who have felt the Operation of the Spirit, are certain, and do know, <hi>that man,</hi> if he be one of Gods Darlings, conſiſts not only of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> but alſo of <hi>the Spirit</hi> or Image of God: wherefore it is not ſaid in vain by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The natural Man,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the <hi>Soulliſh</hi> or <hi>Animal Man,</hi> to wit, he who is deſtitute of the Image of God, or who has not the Spirit, <hi>receiveth not the things of God, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned:</hi> And therefore it is, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle alſo diſtinguiſheth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.44. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>a natural</hi> properly a Soulliſh <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>a Spiritual Body,</hi> the one whereof is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the Soul, and the other by the Spirit. And <hi>James</hi> 3.15. <hi>The Wiſdom which is from above,</hi> that is, which is Spiritual, is oppoſed to that which is <hi>Earthly</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> or <hi>Senſual,</hi> (but the word is here again <hi>Soulliſh</hi> and <hi>Deviliſh</hi>) in <hi>Jude</hi> again <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. <hi>The Natural</hi> or <hi>Senſual,</hi> (but the word is again the Soulliſh) are oppoſed to <hi>thoſe that have the Spirit.</hi> And therefore <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Having purified your Souls by the Spirit.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.22.</p>
               <p>From all which places it appears very plainly, that the perfect or true Man does
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48714:54"/>not only conſiſt of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> but alſo of <hi>the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for as much as the ungodly, and Sinners do enjoy the two former, <hi>Viz. Body,</hi> and <hi>Soul,</hi> as well as the Faithful, and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and yet do not underſtand thoſe things, which are of the Spirit, it follows that they muſt needs want that by which Spiritual things are alone to be diſcerned, now that which diſcerns Spiritual things, is the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14, 15.</p>
               <p n="40">§. 40. It is true, that often times the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man is in the Holy Scripture deſcribed by two Beings, to wit, the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> as this Apoſtle ſpeaks at large, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. of <hi>them that walk after the ſpirit, and not after the Fleſh,</hi> and deſcribes the regenerate as thoſe <hi>which walk after the ſpirit, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the Fleſh,</hi> and the Ungodly, as walking after the fleſh, and as not having the Spirit. And <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.7. he ſaith, that he has the fleſh and the Spirit, and that theſe two do War againſt each other, <hi>for the fleſh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh, and theſe are contrary the one to the other,</hi> by reaſon of which conflict, which the Apoſtle felt in himſelf, he complained <hi>Rom</hi> 7. that <hi>after the inward Man,</hi> that is, <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Law of his mind,</hi> or after the Spirit, <hi>he delighteth in the Law of God, but that the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48714:54"/>Law in his Members,</hi> that is to ſay, the Fleſh <hi>warreth againſt the Law of God.</hi> And there are many other ſuch like places in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, which do oppoſe the Fleſh to the Spirit: but in theſe and the like pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the ſcope is not ſo much to teach us how many parts there are in a perfect Man, as to ſhew us that Man, who is not yet perfectly born again, has a Warfare againſt his Fleſh, that is, againſt his unregenerate part.</p>
               <p>But no man can be ſo fooliſh as to think, that when it is here ſaid, that the Fleſh luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt the Spirit, that we muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by underſtand only the Fleſh or Body, but that under the Term Fleſh, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that part of Man, that is called the Soul, which deſireth and thinkerh, and luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and it is notorious, that this is uſual in the Holy Scripture, by the word Fleſh, alſo to underſtand the Soul from hence, becauſe, when the Holy Scripture oppoſes the new birth unto Sin, it uſes the Terms <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Fleſh,</hi> as was juſt now ſhewed. But it does not only oppoſe the Spirit to the Fleſh, but alſo the Spirit to the Soul; or to the Soulliſh part, as we but juſt now ſhewed in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>James</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From whence then it evidently appears, that the fleſhly part is included in the Soulliſh part, and that by the fleſhly part is meant the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48714:55"/>Soulliſh part. And that the Soul has fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Body, and does continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally co-operate with it, we will ſhew in the next Chapter, where we ſhall particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Treat of the Soul.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Image of God, or the Spirit.</head>
            <p n="42">§. 42. SEing it is eaſie to be underſtood from the precedent Chapter, that a perfect Man conſiſts in theſe three, to wit, <hi>Spirit, Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> we are here eſpecially to conſider, what the <hi>Spirit,</hi> or <hi>the Image of God is, and the properties thereof,</hi> as alſo, <hi>the neceſſity of the Sinners being reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his former State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="43">§. 43. Every body knows, that when an Image, Picture, or likeneſs of a Man is made, that it muſt reſemble him after whom it is made, becauſe if it have no reſemblance of him whom it repreſents, it could not be called his Image, Picture or likeneſs.</p>
            <p n="44">§. 44. Seing then that Man is made after Gods Image, man muſt needs bear the Image or Likeneſs of God.</p>
            <pb n="97" facs="tcp:48714:56"/>
            <p n="45">§. 45. Now this Image which Man has of God, cannot be or conſiſt in the outward Shape of his Body, but in his Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is a Spirit, and has no bodily or outward ſhape, form or figure at all, as is ſhewed already §. 12.</p>
            <p n="46">§. 46. But becauſe we Sinners have loſt it, and ſo cannot, as <hi>Adam,</hi> know what manner of Being the Being of God is, by contemplating the Image of God which was in him, it is needful that we firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire at the Holy Scriptures, how the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being is there deſcribed, that ſo from the Divine Being we may learn what the <hi>Image</hi> or <hi>Likeneſs</hi> of God muſt needs be.</p>
            <p n="47">§. 47. The Holy Scripture then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the Being of God not only to be a Spirit, but alſo ſhews, what manner of Spirit it is, to wit, that God is <hi>a Light,</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> Micah 7.8. <hi>The Lord ſhall be a Light unto me.</hi> And 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.5. it is in expreſs words ſaid, that <hi>God is a Light in whom there is no Darkneſs at all,</hi> to wit, in oppoſition to the Created Spirits or Lights, which do conſiſt not only of a Fiery, but alſo of a Spiritual-watry Subſtance, as ſhall be ſhewed in the Chapter of the Life, or of the Soul. And <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Hebrews</hi> 12.29. <hi>The Lord your God is a conſuming
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48714:57"/>Fire,</hi> and many times when God appeared to his People, it was in a Fire or Light.</p>
            <p n="48">§. 48. We ſhall as we go along, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our Thoughts, why God is ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be <hi>a Light,</hi> and ſometimes to be a <hi>Fire,</hi> and leave them to the further conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Reader.</p>
            <p>We ſhall every where find, that where God is ſaid to be <hi>a Fire,</hi> he is repreſented as a Judge executing Puniſhment, and on the contrary, that he is called a <hi>Light,</hi> where he diſplays his Grace, Favour and Mercy, by which Grace man is ſaved: And thus God can be both <hi>a Light</hi> and <hi>a Fire;</hi> a Light to them which purify their Hearts, and that have put on the new Man; and ſo are capable of enjoying of Gods preſence by vertue of the Spiritual Fellowſhip which they have with their God: Whereas on the Contrary, he is <hi>a Fire</hi> to thoſe which have not mortifyed the old Man, or their fleſh, ſo that their impurity, to wit, their Carnal corruption cannot ſtand before the pure, and clean <hi>Divine Fire.</hi> But that we may ſhew this yet more plainly even in Nature it ſelf; we muſt conſider that one and the ſame Fire is to ſome Subjects, and in ſome reſpects a conſuming Fire, and to others not ſo, nor able to do the leaſt dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to them; as is moſt manifeſt in the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48714:57"/>imperfect Metals, which are conſumed in the <hi>Fire,</hi> whereas on the contrary the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Metals, as Gold and Silver, are not in the leaſt to be conſumed by <hi>fire,</hi> ſo that the <hi>fire,</hi> with reſpect to Gold and Silver, is properly no <hi>fire,</hi> to wit, no fire that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes them or burns them, as it does burn the imperfect and impure Metals.</p>
            <p n="49">§. 49. Therefore from the Deſcription which the Holy Scriptures give us of the Being of God, it is evident that it is <hi>a Light</hi> and <hi>a Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="50">§. 50 Seing then the Being of God is <hi>a Light,</hi> and that man is Created after the Image of God, it muſt needs follow that this Image in man is alſo <hi>a Light;</hi> for (as is ſaid §. 45.) becauſe the Divine being is a Spirit, which has no outward ſhape or form, the Image muſt needs alſo be a Spirit, and ſuch a Spirit as bears reſemblance to that which it repreſents, to wit it muſt be <hi>a Light</hi> as God is <hi>a Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="51">§. 51. Now that the Image of God, or Spirit of the mind (as its called <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.) conſiſts in an inward Light, the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teaches us, for <hi>he that putteth on the new Man, which is Created after God, and who is renewed in knowledge after the Image of him
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48714:58"/>that Created him,</hi> Col. 2.10. is ſaid Eph. 5.8. <hi>To be Light in the Lord, ye were ſometimes Darkneſs, but now are ye Light,</hi> Col. 1.12. <hi>which has made us meet to be partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</hi> And that inheritance, ſaith the Apoſtle, is <hi>the Light</hi> &amp; this <hi>Light</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt Pſ.</hi> 97.11. <hi>is ſown) for the Righteous,</hi> and Pſ. 112.4. <hi>unto the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right there ariſeth Light in the Darkneſs.</hi> And thus are the Faithful ſaid to be <hi>Children of the Light,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.5.</p>
            <p n="52">§. 52. But that it may yet further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the Image of God is <hi>Light,</hi> which Image or Light they receive, who do mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their fleſh with the Luſts thereof, it will be needful to enquire into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties or Nature of the Image of God, and of that Light, which is given to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that ſo it may farther appear from the conſonant properties thereof, that the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God is <hi>a Light,</hi> and even that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame Light, which the Faithful do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
            <p n="53">§. 53. When God had Created man after his Image, it is written <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. <hi>And let them have Dominion over the Fiſh of the Sea, and over the Fowls of the Aire, and over the Cattle, and over all the Earth, and over eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth.</hi> From whence it is evident, that the Image of God makes men meet to Rule over the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48714:58"/>whole Earth: And thus alſo it is ſaid of the Faithful <hi>Pſ.</hi> 25.13. <hi>That his ſeed ſhall inherit the Earth,</hi> and Pſal. 37.11. <hi>The meek ſhall inherit the Earth;</hi> which is again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.5. Now what is it, <hi>to poſſeſs the Earth?</hi> but to be Lord and Maſter of it, as it is the Right of an <hi>Heir</hi> to be. And <hi>Mark</hi> 9.23. Our Saviour ſays: <hi>If thou canſt believe all things are poſſible to him that believeth:</hi> and what he meant by <hi>all things,</hi> our Saviour ſhews at large <hi>Mark</hi> 16.17, 18. And <hi>theſe Signs ſhall follow them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, in my name ſhall they caſt out Devils, they ſhall ſpeak with new Tongues; they ſhall take up Serpents, and if they drink any dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing, it ſhall not hurt them, they ſhall lay hands on the ſick and they ſhall recover.</hi> And Luke 10.20. <hi>The Spirit are ſubject to you;</hi> and ſuch other places, which do evidently ſhew us, that the faithful that have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Light have the ſame Power as Man had before he loſt the Image of God.</p>
            <p n="54">§. 54. And as Man that was Created af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Image of God, had Power <hi>to fill the earth,</hi> and <hi>to ſubdue it, Gen.</hi> 1.28. So thoſe that have received the <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Light,</hi> are ſaid to mortify and ſubdue their Fleſh, that is the Earthly part, and to make it Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Knowing this, that our old man is Crucified with him, that the body of ſin might
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48714:59"/>be deſtroyed.</hi> But it is more properly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: <hi>weakned</hi> or <hi>impeded in its working.</hi> And Rom. 8.11, 12, 13. <hi>But if the Spirit of him that raiſed up Chriſt from the Dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies by his ſpirit that dwelleth in you. Therefore Brethren, we are Debtors not to the fleſh, to live after the fleſh: for if ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die, but if ye through the ſpirit do mortify the deeds of the Body ye ſhall live.</hi> And Gal. 5.24. And <hi>they that are Chriſts have Crucified the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſh with the Luſts.</hi> And this is treated of at Large <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="55">§. 55. Now before man had ſinned, while the Image of God yet ſhined in his inward parts, how great Wiſdom and Knowledge in all things did attend him continually? It muſt needs have at leaſt been ſuch, that he did not only ſee through the external Objects, the frame of things, but alſo muſt have had knowledge of their moſt inward ſtate, to wit, of the Spirit, or Life of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, becauſe he underſtood how to give Names to all things according to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.19. <hi>And when the Lord God had formed out of the Ground every Beaſt of the field, and every Fowle of the Aire, he brought them unto Adam to ſee what he would call them, and whatſoever Adam called every living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that was the name thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="103" facs="tcp:48714:59"/>
            <p>Now he that knows the nature of any thing, he has knowledge of its inward ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Being, of its qualifications and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working; on the ſame manner it is alſo ſaid concerning the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> which the Faithful do receive and enjoy, to wit, that he gives them wiſdom to diſcern Spirits, and all Spiritual Gifts; and therefore the Apoſtle calls it <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17, 18. <hi>The Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him, enlightning the eyes of the underſtanding.</hi> And this Spirit of Wiſdom is by <hi>Solomon</hi> very gloriouſly deſcribed in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> throughout, and the Fruits thereof, in the 2d. <hi>Chapter</hi> he ſhews what Profit they reap, <hi>that incline their Ears unto Wiſdom, and that apply their hearts unto underſtanding;</hi> to wit, that they do thereby <hi>underſtand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God,</hi> &amp;c. The Apoſtle alſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, deſcribes this Light or Spirit to be that which <hi>gives the word of Wiſdom, the word of Knowledge, the gifts of Healing, the Working of Miracles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, the diſcerning of Spirits, many Tongues, and ſuch like.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="56">§. 56. Which conſonant properties do therefore plainly ſhew, that the Spirit of the Light, which the Faithful do receive from God, is that very ſame Image of God which he firſt man loſt by Sin: For
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48714:60"/>
               <list>
                  <item>1. As the firſt man had by the Image of God Dominion over all things, ſo do the Faithful by the Spirit or Light, Rule over all things.</item>
                  <item>2. As the firſt Man had Power by the Image of God to ſubdue the Earth, ſo do the Faithful by the Spririt ſubdue their fleſh, and the Luſts thereof.</item>
                  <item>3. And ſo are the Faithful inwardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by the Spirit, that they have the diſcerning of Spirits, and do know hidden things, juſt as <hi>Adam</hi> had by the Image of God, a knowledge of the Spirits, and of all Creatures.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="57">§. 57. Thus far then have we ſhewed, that the Image of God conſiſts in an inward Light, and that this Light is the ſame, with which the Faithful are enlightned: Yet permit us here, Reader, who mayeſt read this more out of curioſity, then out of any love to truth, further to enquire who and what manner of thing this Image of God is, that a man that loves God, and ſeeks to live in Chriſt, may go on in this way more and more to ſearch out the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Wiſdom of God, which he does ſo abundantly make known in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to them that ſeek him.</p>
            <p n="58">§. 58. The Holy Scripture does not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48714:60"/>ſay, that the Image of God does conſiſt in <hi>a Light,</hi> but it does alſo teach us, <hi>who it is that is the Image of God.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, 2 Cor. 4.4. <hi>Leſt the Light of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the Image of God,</hi> &amp;c. And Col. 1.15. <hi>Who is the Image of the inviſible God.</hi> So that hence it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that Chriſt is the Image of God: and as we have already ſhewed, that the Image of God is a Light, ſo it is alſo ſaid of Chriſt <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.9. <hi>That he is the true Light that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightneth every man that comes into the World.</hi> And Chap. 8.12. Then ſpake Jeſus unto them, ſaying, <hi>I am the Light of the world, he that followeth me ſhall not walk in darkneſs, but ſhall have the light of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="59">§. 59. And becauſe Chriſt is the Image of God that enlightens every man, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid, that the Spirit of Chriſt is in the Faithful. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>And becauſe ye are Sons, God has ſent forth the ſpirit of his</hi> (Gods) <hi>Son into your hearts.</hi> And Eph. 3.16.17. <hi>That he would grant you to be ſtrengthened with might, by his Spirit in the Inner-Man: that Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by faith.</hi> And Rom. 8.29. <hi>He that has the Spirit of Chriſt is conformed to the Image of his Son.</hi> So that from theſe places, and many more (which every one can obſerve in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Scripture) it is manifeſt,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48714:61"/>that the Image of God in man, <hi>is the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> which Spirit becauſe it proceeds from Chriſt, who is the Image of God, is that Image of God which Man poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>Now how Chriſt can be ſaid to be the Head, and the Faithful his Members, which are all guided by the ſame Spirit, every true ſeeker can underſtand in himſelf, when he conſiders that Chriſt is the Image of God, who gives his Spirit to all the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, by which they are all Members of one Body, which is Ruled by the Spirit of Chirſt.</p>
            <p>In like manner may eaſily be drawn from this Spring, how Man can be ſaid to be <hi>Gods Off-ſpring, and that we live and move, and have our Being in God.</hi> But every one that has the Spirit of Chriſt, will beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in his Inner-Man, how that <hi>Spirit</hi> gives him Communion with God.</p>
            <p n="60">§. 60. And ſeing Chriſt is the Image of God, who gives his <hi>Spirit</hi> to Man, that he may be a perfect Right Man, it is neceſſary that we do hence ſhew the neceſſity of the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, to reconcile faln Man to God again.</p>
            <p n="60">§. 61. Reaſon teaches us, <hi>that nothing can attain to its former perfection, except it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48714:61"/>again that which it formerly poſſeſſed,</hi> to wit, <hi>that which was the cauſe of its perfection.</hi> Yea this is evident in all Machines, and Mechanick Inſtruments; all which clearly ſhews us, that when they come to want that which once they had for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Work, to which they were fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that either that Work does ceaſe, or is not performed ſo perfectly as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p n="62">§. 62. If then we do well conſider this univerſal Truth, and bring it over, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in unto Man, it is certain, that ſeeing Man was Created ſo upright, that he had that capacity of being united to his God, the Sinner muſt receive the ſame capacity, that he may be united with his God again.</p>
            <p n="63">§. 63. Yea it is impoſſible that he ſhould receive any other thing inſtead of it, but that very thing which he loſt, becauſe if he ſhould receive any other thing inſtead of it, he would want that which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a perfect Man, and would receive ſomething which he had not in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo the beſt part that Man had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God in the Creation would conſequently be uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>Beſides, when it is ſaid that God Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Man upright, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. there muſt
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48714:62"/>have been in man all that was neceſſary for the attaining of Gods end; that the Sinner then may perform what God intended by him, he muſt receive again that which God gave him in his Creation to that end: Even not any thing better, nor any other thing can he receive, becauſe God at firſt made all things after the moſt perfect manner in the Creation, according to §. 30. So that in is impoſſible that the Sinner can receive any thing better, or any other thing from God, but that very thing which he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God in the Creation; becauſe, if he ſhould receive any other thing, that thing could not be better, but worſe, and ſo he would not be able to fulfil what God aimed at by him, becauſe God Created man, after the moſt perfect manner.</p>
            <p>From all which in then follows, that the Sinner cannot be made perfect in another way, but by receiving again that very Image of God which he loſt by Sin.</p>
            <p n="64">§. 64. Now that the Salvation of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner conſiſts in the recovering of this Image of God, the Holy Scripture does ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly teſtify, that there is nothing held forth unto us more in the Holy Scripture, than that our Salvation does conſiſt in the receiving of the Spirit and Image of God again, as is manifeſt from the places by us
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48714:62"/>already cited, §. 51.53, 54, 55. and of which <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. and <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3. &amp;c. do treat.</p>
            <p n="65">§. 65. But now altho' we have diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the Sinner cannot attain unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, unleſs he receive again the Image of God, yet this difficulty ſtill remains in the caſe, to find out, <hi>how and by what means the ſinner can recover this Image of God again?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="66">§. 66. It is then an univerſal truth in Nature, <hi>that nothing can be meliorated nor united with another thing, ſo as to bring forth fruit thereby, except there be a previous ſuffering, dying or mortification.</hi> (To wit, ſuch a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, death or mortification as tends to melioration, not ſuch a death as tends to putrefaction, for there are theſe two ſorts of Death, as for Example, the Seed paſſeth through a death, in order to the bringing forth of Fruit, and ſometimes it dyes ſo, that it remains in putrefaction, out of which no new Seed but Worms are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.) Now that ſuch a dying or morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication muſt go before the Union is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in Trees, whoſe Twigs or Buds when they are Ingrafted, or Inoculated, they dye as it were, and wither, before they can unite with the Tree, in like manner can no Seed unite with the Earth, ſo as to bring forth Fruit, unleſs it firſt dyes, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48714:63"/>therefore it is, that our Saviour ſaith with reſpect to the profit which was to accrue unto ſinners by his Death, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.24. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a grain of Wheat fall into the ground and dye, it abideth alone,</hi> that is, it cannot then be united with the Earth to Multiply; <hi>but if it dye it bringeth forth much fruit,</hi> and 1 Cor. 15.36. <hi>That which thou ſoweſt is not quickened except it dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="67">§. 67. Now to bring this Univerſal truth home unto faln Man, (how he fell, we ſhall ſhew hereafter) we ſhall find that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does expreſly teach us, that no man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attain to the Image of God again, ſo as to bring forth Fruits of Righteouſneſs, but by a dying as our Saviour teſtifies <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.24. under the ſimilitude of a grain of Wheat, not only applying this unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he muſt dye, in order to acquire unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Church or People, but he alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys the ſame to them which will be his his Followers. For <hi>Verſe</hi> 25.26. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith, <hi>He that loves his life ſhall looſe it,</hi> that is, he that fears to follow me for fear of Death, he ſhall dye without bringing forth Fruit: and <hi>he that hateth his life in this World, ſhall keep it unto life Eternal:</hi> that is, he that fears not death, but will chearfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up himſelf unto death for my name ſake, he ſhall by his death bring forth Fruit,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48714:63"/>which ſhall not change, but abide for ever. And therefore Chriſt adds: <hi>if any man will ſerve me let him follow me;</hi> that is, let him give himſelf chearfully up unto the death, as I do now give my ſelf up unto it. And very expreſly ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3. Concerning the Faithful; <hi>ye are dead, and your life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> And V. 5. <hi>Mortify therefore your members which are upon Earth,</hi> &amp;c. Now becauſe ſuffering and Death muſt go before Glorification, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.22. <hi>that we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of God through much tribulation.</hi> Moreover if we conſider the manners of Speech uſed by the Apoſtles, concerning the manner, how the Sinner recovers the Image or Spirit of God again, how emphatically do they repreſent unto us, that no ſinner can attain unto any fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Spirit, <hi>except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God;</hi> that is, <hi>if a Man be not born of Water, and of the Spirit,</hi> as our Saviour there further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5.

               <hi>being born again through the Reſurrection of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48714:64"/>Jeſus Chriſt from the dead.</hi> Now this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that if we be born again by the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jeſus Chriſt, we muſt firſt have been dead; wherefore from all this it is manifeſt that no man can recover the Image of God again, but through ſuffering and death.</p>
            <p n="68">§. 68. But now for as much <hi>as no Sinner has any the leaſt power to give unto himſelf Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> according to the Teſtimony of the Holy Scripture, an that every one finds in his own experience that he is nncapable of coferring upon himſelf any perfection, it follows, <hi>that that Being which reſtores him, muſt be more perfect than the Sinner himſelf, and yet ſuch as can unite, and have fellowſhip with man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It muſt be more <hi>Perfect</hi> than the Sinner, becauſe if he had no greater Perfections than he, he could not impart unto the Sinner that which he himſelf ſhould want.</p>
            <p>It muſt alſo be ſuch, as <hi>can be united,</hi> and <hi>have fellowſhip</hi> with man, becauſe that which cannot be united, or have fellowſhip with another thing, cannot make the thing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or change its ſtate for the better, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Melioration doth require the moſt cloſe union; that is, a Spiritual union with the life of that thing which is changed, for the Life being the worker of all our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48714:64"/>and the former of its own body (as is proved in the Obſervations of Bar. <hi>Van Helmont</hi> concerning Man, §. 34, 35, 36, 37.) it is neceſſary, that this Union be with the life it ſelf, that ſo the life may come to change its former working.</p>
            <p n="69">§. 69. Moreover, <hi>This Being that ſhould thus change the ſinner, muſt not only be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than he, but it muſt alſo be ſo perfect, that it can give perfection unto other Beings.</hi> Or elſe it would be of no uſe to the Sinner; as for Example, It is manifeſt, that Gold has more perfection in it than Iron has, but Gold cannot therefore communicate its perfection to the Iron, while it ſelf remains meer natural Gold, becauſe it has no more perfection that it ſelf ſtands in need of to be Gold: in like manner we ſay of all Creatures or Created Beings, none excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that altho' they had more perfection than the Sinner, yet they cannot commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate their perfection to the Sinner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they poſſeſs no more perfection than juſt belongs to their own Beings.</p>
            <p>Beſides, Seing Man is the head Work, or moſt excellent piece of all the Creatures upon Earth, as is already proved: it is impoſſible that any Creature can give him any perfection: from whence neceſſarily follows, that no Creature can reſtore him
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48714:65"/>to his primitive Perfection and integrity.</p>
            <p n="70">§. 70. Stand here ſtill with me. O thou truth loving Reader! and contemplate what manner of Being that muſt needs be then, which according to the order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in all things) muſt reſtore the Sinner to his priſtine ſtate?</p>
            <p n="71">§. 71. In the 68. §. we have proved, the Sinner muſt be reſtored by a more perfect Being than himſelf, and not only ſo, but that it muſt have power to impart of its perfection unto the Creature; but this is impoſſible for any Creature to do, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to §. 69. yea this being muſt not only be ſo perfect, but it muſt be ſuch as muſt have fellowſhip with, and be united unto Man according to §. 68.</p>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48714:65"/>Creator? becauſe the Creature depends upon the Creator, and the Creator does continually uphold his Creatures.</p>
            <p n="73">§. 73. Thus far then it follows, beyond all Contradiction, that the ſinner cannot be reſtored, but by his Creator; But ſeing (according to §. 61.) that nothing can come to its former perfection, unleſs it reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that which was the cauſe of its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; yea, that it is impoſſible, that the ſinner can by any thing elſe recover his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive perfection, but by that very thing alone with he loſt, as is proved §. 63. and his priſtine or Primitive Perfection having conſiſted in the Spirit or Image of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to §. 63.64. and ſeing the ſinner cannot be reſtored to his former Eſtate, but by his Creator, according to §. 71.72. and that he cannot receive any thing elſe but the image of God, which can bring him thereunto, according to §. 63.64. it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follows, <hi>that the Creator muſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be that Image of God, which man ſtands in need of</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="74">§. 74. Now it is manifeſt to every one that reads the Holy Scriptures, that Chriſt is ſaid to be the Creator of Heaven and Earth, as may be ſeen <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. <hi>By him were all things Created,</hi> &amp;c. Seing then, that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48714:66"/>the Holy Scripture ſhews us, that Chriſt is he which Created us, then he muſt alſo needs be that Image of God, which Man had in the ſtate of his uprightneſs and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity; and that Chriſt is that Image of God, we have already proved at large §. 58.59.</p>
            <p n="75">§. 75. From all theſe then it is manifeſt that none can reſtore us to our firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection <hi>but Chriſt alone,</hi> who was the Image of God in us, which became darkned in us through Sin. But for as much as §. 66.67. it is proved, that nothing can be united to another thing, but through ſuffering, and death, it is of great conſequence now to ſhew: <hi>how and on what manner ſinners may, and by no other means can be united to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="76">§. 76. Now to ſearch out it what manner ſinners muſt be united to the Image of God, it is not only enough, that we know that Chriſt is our Creator, and the Image of God, which alone is able to reſtore the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner into his Perfect State, but we muſt <hi>alſo well mind this truth,</hi> in order to a further diſcovery of the Union betwixt the Sinner and the Image of God, <hi>viz That nothing can unite except the things which are to be united, do meet, to wit, the uniter, and that which is united.</hi> So that we muſt here conſider,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48714:66"/>what manner of thing that muſt be, which is to be united with Chriſt, who is the Image of God (that ſinners may thereby be reſtored unto the ſtate of Integrity again, to wit, to have fellowſhip again with God) from whom it had ſeparated, and eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it ſelf by ſin.</p>
            <p n="77">§. 77. It is manifeſt from §. 73. that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners cannot be again reſtored unto their former ſtate of Integrity, except they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that which they loſt, now we do fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay on the other ſide, that that which was loſt, cannot be re-united unto man again, except the nature of man can and do receive it. For if it were ſome thing, that were either too mean or too Glorious for man to receive, then it could not be united unto man, but unto ſome thing elſe; and <hi>therefore it was that Chriſt could not be united unto any thing elſe but unto the nature of man,</hi> that he might reſtore mans nature into its former ſtate: For had Chriſt been united with any thing elſe, but the nature of Man, he could not thereby have reſtored man; but only that with which he had been united, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Union with any other thing would have been of no advantage to the ſinner at all, nor could have united him with the Image of God: but this is that, which we are now to prove according to §. 75.</p>
            <pb n="118" facs="tcp:48714:67"/>
            <p n="78">§. 78. Now altho' it be clear from §. 76. That Chriſt was to take upon him the Nature of Man, that he might reſtore unto ſinners the Image of God, yet is that not enough, that Chriſt ſhould only have taken upon him the Nature of Man, but it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo moſt neceſſary, <hi>that Chriſt ſhould take upon him the nature of ſuch a man, as of whom all mankind does depend, and from whom all men did come, or are deſcended.</hi> Becauſe the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all things teaches us, that the whole race of any thing cannot be Meliorated, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Source or Root be amended, from whence the whole Race, or all the Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are deſcended; as for example, when a whole Tree does not bear good Fruit, it is neceſſary that the whole Tree be amended by Tranſplantation, and cutting off the Branches and Pruning the Roots, and not one or more of the Branches only; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Tree bears the Branches, and the Branches not the Tree; Wherefore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' ſome of the Branches ſhould be cut off, and Grafted upon another Tree, thoſe Branches which are ſo cut off, and re-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted, would in themſelves be amended, but not the whole Tree from which they were cut off.</p>
            <p>To make this plain, there is no better way, than for us to make a Trial from our own Selves: As for Example, When the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48714:67"/>whole Man is ſick, and out of Order, ſo that the Diſtemper proceeds from the Life it ſelf, and not from the unſoundneſs of any one of the Parts or Members, the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is, Whether any one can be ſo fooliſh as to endeavour to reſtore his whole Being unto Health, by cutting off an Arm or a Leg, or by applying Remedies to them? Verily no, but he will endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Cauſe by ſuch Means, as the Life can receive, or as can be communicated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, becauſe the Life is the Former of our Body, (as I have proved in the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of B. <hi>Van Helmont</hi> concerning Man, in §. 34.35, 36, 37, 38.)</p>
            <p>Now to apply this to the Caſe in hand, I ſay then, that if Chriſt had not taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him that particular Humanity or the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that Man, from which all men are deſcended, he could not have reſtored unto all men the Image of God again, but only unto that particular Man-hood alone, unto which he was united, and yet, that all men muſt recover the Image of God again, we ſhall ſhew hereafter. Juſt as a Branch which is Ingrafted upon another Tree, is thereby indeed amended, but not the whole Tree from whence it was cut off. It is a thing contrary to Nature, that all the parts of any thing ſhould be bettered any where, ſave in their Original or Source;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48714:68"/>Yea this is contrary to every (even the very leaſt) thing in Nature. For as much then as this is an univerſal truth in Nature, therefore it muſt alſo needs be a truth in the bettering of Mankind; becauſe Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſtands united, and ſubjected to the ſame natural Order, as all other things, and without which Order man cannot produce any thing. Therefore, that Chriſt might reunite Sinners to himſelf, he was to take upon him that individual Humanity or Manhood, of which all men are deſcended.</p>
            <p>And if we diligently examine the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation which the Apoſtle holds <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. We ſhall find that the Apoſtle ſignifies, that Chriſt did take upon him <hi>ſuch a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> or humane nature, as by which all men could be ſaved; ſuch as was that of <hi>Adam,</hi> by whom all Men became Sinners. For the Apoſtle ſhews not only <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>that being reconciled, we are ſaved by the Life of Christ.</hi> But alſo Verſ. 11. <hi>that we joy in God,</hi> to wit, that we are aſſured that God is our Father, who will communicate unto us of his Glory, and the cauſe of this our Joying is, that <hi>we have received the Atonement by Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſome will perhaps ask here: how or on what wiſe could Chriſt reconcile us.</p>
            <p>This Queſtion the Apoſtle anſwers in V. 12. ſaying, <hi>Wherefore,</hi> (that is, on this wiſe,) <hi>as by one man ſin entred into the World,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48714:68"/>and death by ſin, and ſo death paſſed upon all men, in whom all have ſinned,</hi> that is to ſay, juſt <hi>as by one man ſin came into the World,</hi> ſo on the very ſame manner is the Atonement made <hi>by one man,</hi> to wit, by Jeſus Chriſt; and that <hi>as by ſin, death,</hi> ſo by the Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Life is received; and <hi>as death is ſo paſſed upon all men,</hi> ſo is <hi>the righteouſneſs of Jeſus come upon all men unto Juſtification of life.</hi> And as death is paſſed upon all men, <hi>becauſe they all ſinned <hi>In Adam:</hi>
               </hi> For <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> cannot here ſignify <hi>[for that]</hi> as in our <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but <hi>in whom,</hi> as in the States Dutch Bible, nor can it have any relation to any other, but to that one Man, <hi>Adam,</hi> (eſpecially if you add unto it V. 18.19.) So there is the very ſame reaſon of the Atonement of Chriſt. For Chriſt has made the Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for all men, becauſe they are all juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Chriſt. Now this is plain, ſeing the Apoſtle draws here a Parallel betwixt <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; Chriſt, that that Parallel muſt hold ſo far as he makes it to go. Let us then ſee how far this Parallel which he makes betwixt Chriſt and <hi>Adam v.</hi> 12 muſt go.</p>
            <p>It is certain, according to this ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>That ſin entred into the World by Adam, and death by ſin,</hi> and ſo death <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon all men, becauſe they all ſinned <hi>in Adam;</hi>
               </hi> that the true reaſon here rendered, why all Men are Sinners; is, <hi>becauſe they all
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48714:69"/>ſinned in Adam:</hi> Now if they did all ſin in <hi>Adam,</hi> they muſt all have been in <hi>Adam,</hi> and muſt all have depended upon him, as upon their Head, and Beginning, or elſe they could not all have ſinned in <hi>Adam.</hi> Juſt thus muſt this Parallel hold alſo in Chriſt: Righteouſneſs is obtain'd through Chriſt, and this Righteouſneſs comes upon all becauſe they are juſtified in Chriſt. Now this muſt be as true in Chriſt as it was in <hi>Adam;</hi> to wit, that ſeing all men depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon and were hid in <hi>Adam,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did ſin with him, ſo alſo muſt all men be dependent in Chriſt, as on their Head, that is, they muſt depend on his humane Nature, or manhood, as well as on that of <hi>Adam,</hi> if they are to be all juſtified in him: For ſeing, as §. 76. nothing can be united to another, except the Unitor, and the thing united do meet in one; and ſeing man cannot be reſtored to his former ſtate, except the image of God takes Manhood upon him According to §. 77. it muſt needs follow, that if the Image of God, to wit, Chriſt takes upon him ſuch a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, as whereby all men are juſtified; that that Manhood muſt be that of the firſt Man, of whom all men are deſcended, and have received their life, becauſe that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all men could not be partakers of righteouſneſs by the Manhood of Chriſt,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48714:69"/>and for as much as all men deſcended of <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo do depend upon him, as upon their beginning, from whom they are Born, ſo Chriſt could not juſtify all men in him, except he took upon him <hi>Adams</hi> Mandhood, of which all men are depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
            <p>And for further confirmation of what we ſay from that which the Apoſtle ſays, to wit, That Chriſt muſt needs have taken upon him the Manhood of <hi>Adam:</hi> in the firſt place we muſt conſider, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in the 14. V. ſaith: That <hi>Adam</hi> was a Figure or Type of Chriſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Chriſt muſt be a man, or muſt take upon him a Manhood, as the Apoſtle affirms V. 15. where he calls Jeſus Chriſt a Man. <hi>2d.</hi> As death reign'd over all men by one, to wit, by <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo life reigns over all Men by one, to wit, by Jeſus Chriſt, V. 17. Therefore the Antitype muſt alſo agree in this reſpect, according to the ſaying of the Apoſtle, that is, Chriſt muſt be the Head of all men, as well as <hi>Adam</hi> was; and that the Apoſtle proves very ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly V. 18.19. Becauſe <hi>that as by the one tranſgreſſion of</hi> Adam <hi>all men are made ſinners, ſo alſo by the one righteouſneſs of Chriſt all men receive life.</hi> If then all men do receive life by the one righteouſneſs of Chriſt, then Chriſt muſt be the head of all men, as well
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48714:70"/>as <hi>Adam</hi> was; and all men muſt deſcend from him, as well as from <hi>Adam;</hi> becauſe elſe Chriſts righteouſneſs could not come upon all men, which yet the Apoſtle does moſt expreſly affirm, V. 18. whence then does undoubtedly follow, that ſeing <hi>Adam</hi> is the Head of all Mankind, and ſeing Chriſt has done the ſame thing that <hi>Adam</hi> did, to wit, in the Antitheſis, that the Man Jeſus Chriſt muſt needs alſo have been the Head of all Mankind: And for as much as none but <hi>Adam</hi> can be the Head of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, it muſt needs follow that Chriſt muſt have taken upon him <hi>Adams Mandhood,</hi> that he might juſtify all men by his own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> I. But in Anſwer to this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence which we draw from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. That Chriſt cannot have taken upon him other Manhood but that of <hi>Adam,</hi> if all Men be ſo juſtified in Chriſt, as they all ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> it will be ſaid that that manner of Speech, that <hi>all men are juſtified in Chriſt;</hi> is not to be taken for all, &amp; every man, one by one, but for all thoſe which are Born of Chriſt to wit, for the Faithful: For the Apoſtle makes here an Antitheſis betwixt <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt, and betwixt thoſe which are born of <hi>Adam,</hi> and thoſe which are born of Chriſt; ſo that thoſe which are born of Chriſt; are not born of him after the fleſh, as thoſe which are
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48714:70"/>born of <hi>Adam</hi> are, but after the Spirit, and conſequently, that it does not neceſſarily follow, that Chriſt muſt needs have taken upon him the Manhood of Adam, becauſe they that are born of Chriſt, are not born after the Fleſh but after the Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> For Anſwer to this Objection it is to be obſerved, Firſt, That the Apoſtle does not ſay, that as all that are born of <hi>Adam,</hi> are become ſinful by <hi>Adams</hi> Fall; ſo all that are born after a Spiritual manner of Chriſt, are juſtifyed in him, but he ſays without any Limitation at all, That as by <hi>Adams</hi> Fall all men are become Sinners, juſt ſo by Chriſts Righteouſneſs are all men juſtified: So that he here oppoſes theſe two Effects or Out-workings, to wit, The Tranſgreſſion and the Free Gift of Grace, each to other, and ſhews that as the one has made all Men Sinner, ſo the other has made all men Righteous: Now where the Apoſtle makes no diſtinction as well with reſpect to the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, as with reſpect to the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> by what Juſtice can we then limit the word ALL, and that in one and the ſelf ſame Argument, without offering Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to, and wreſting the Words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is manifeſt that Chriſt as Mediator, was Man, if then thoſe which are ſaid to be born of Chriſt, are only born
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48714:71"/>of him Spiritually, to what purpoſe did Chriſt take the Manhood upon him? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Chriſt needed not to have taken Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood upon him to effect ſuch a Spiritual Birth, as they that make this exception do underſtand by this Birth, as is already ſhewed more at large in the fourth Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Apoſtle does not here op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Spiritual Birth of Chriſt, to the Fleſhly Birth of <hi>Adam:</hi> For Chriſt is not here oppoſed unto <hi>Adam,</hi> with reſpect to his Spiritual Being, but with reſpect to his Manhood: For the Apoſtle ſays, V. 15. <hi>The Man Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and 1 Cor. 15.21. <hi>For ſince by <hi>Man</hi> came Death, ſo by <hi>Man</hi> came alſo the Reſurrection of the Dead,</hi> by man I ſay, ſo that <hi>Adams</hi> Manhood is here oppoſed to the Manhood of Chriſt: and as all Men Fell in the Man <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo muſt all Men alſo be juſtified by the Man Chriſt, and conſequently all men muſt as well be born of Chriſt as of <hi>Adam,</hi> and that in the ſame manner, becauſe they are all juſtified in Chriſt after the ſame manner, according to the Apoſtles Doctrine: As all men Fell in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo in Chriſt are all men reſtored again: Wherefore this exception cannot be admitted here, to wit, that Chriſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates all thoſe whom he juſtifies only after a Spiritual manner, and not as thoſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48714:71"/>that are born of <hi>Adam:</hi> ſeing then all men can have none elſe but <hi>Adam</hi> for their firſt Father; and yet that Chriſt juſtifies all men in that manner, <hi>viz.</hi> by his own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, it neceſſarily follows, that the Man Jeſus Chriſt, could not thus juſtifie all men by his own Righteouſneſs, except he had taken upon him the Manhood of <hi>Adam,</hi> for the reaſons rendred in the former §. 78.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I would willingly underſtand of theſe men, which ſay that all that are juſtified are generated by Chriſt only after a Spiritual Manner, what they mean by that manner of Speech? Do they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by mean that the body proceeds from a ſpiritual beginning (as we have ſhewed in §. 27. as alſo in the <hi>Conſiderations</hi> of B. <hi>Van Helmont</hi> concerning Man §. 93.94) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually formed by his Life, which is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, (as we have ſhewed in the aforeſaid <hi>Conſiderations</hi> §. 13.34, 35, 36, 37.) ſo that the Body muſt be obedient to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of its Life, then I willingly grant them, that the Faithful are born of Chriſt after ſuch a ſpiritual manner. But then they muſt withal grant me, ſeing the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily proceeds from the Spiritual (as we have juſt now ſhewed) that there muſt needs be a fellowſhip betwixt the Spiritual and the Bodily, that is, that they do both come from one and the ſame beginning Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48714:72"/>and conſequently, that the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al muſt always contain in it that from whence the bodily does proceed, or elſe there could be no fellowſhip betwixt theſe two; If then there be ſomewhat in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual which can alſo become corporeal, then this manner of Speaking, concerning a ſpiritual birth, ſigniſies nothing elſe but this, that that, out of which the Body is formed, is Born of Chriſt as well as the Life or Spirit of Man; and then man is born of Chriſt as well as to his Body as to his Spirit: And then this ſpiritual Birth will not at all differ in this ſenſe from the Birth out of <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe thoſe which are born out of <hi>Adam,</hi> are alſo generated out of the ſpiritual (Now that all Births are firſt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, that is, that they do proceed from a ſpiritual beginning I have proved in the <hi>Conſiderations of</hi> B. <hi>Van Helmont concerning Man</hi> §. 93.94.) But becauſe Men now a dayes are Carnal, and unacquainted with that which is ſpiritual, they are utterly ignorant, that all things muſt needs have come from a Spiritual beginning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Suppoſe yet that we granted them the Point, to wit, that thoſe which are juſtified in Chriſt are born of Chriſt only after a ſpiritual manner: Does this ſpiritual birth relate to the Soul alone, or to the Body alſo? That is, to the whole
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48714:72"/>Man? Seing the Apoſtle ſaith, that the <hi>Man</hi> and not the Soul alone) <hi>is juſtified;</hi> Now if the Bodily as well as the Spiritual muſt be juſtified, has not Chriſt then gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the Bodily as well as the Spiritual? Verily yes, or elſe the whole man could not be juſtified and conſequently, if the Bodily be juſtified as well as the Soulliſh p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rt then it is abſurd to ſay, that Chriſt hath generated the Righteous only after the Spirit, ſeeing that if he juſtifieth the whole Man, he muſt have generated him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the whole Man, that is, as well after the Body as after the Soul. Wherefore thoſe that make this exception: that Chriſt has generated men after a Spiritual Manner, in Oppoſition to the Generating<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of or from <hi>Adam</hi> muſt either contradict themſelves or confeſs that they ſpeak they know not what.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> II. But it will be again replyed here; that all men were hid or lay dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant in <hi>Adam,</hi> when they ſinned in him, but that all men were not ſo in Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that there were many thouſands alive in the Body ſubſiſting of themſelves, and conſequently that Chriſts Righteouſneſs did not paſs over unto all men, ſo as <hi>Adams</hi> ſin did.</p>
            <pb n="130" facs="tcp:48714:73"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> As to this Objection, to wit: That all men were not ſo hid in Chriſt as in <hi>Adam,</hi> I grant it, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> was the firſt Man of this World, and when he ſinned had not begotten any Children; whereas on the contrary, at the time of the Incarnation of Chriſt, there were many thouſands upon the Earth, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did ſubſiſt of themſelves: But hence it doth not neceſſarily follow, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt could not paſs unto all men, as the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> did. But only this would neceſſarily follow thence: that becauſe many men did live in the time of Chriſt, but when <hi>Adam</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that there were none out of him and <hi>Eve,</hi> alive in the Body, that therefore at that time, when Chriſt wrought that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, all men were not hid in him juſt after the ſame Manner as they were hid in <hi>Adam,</hi> out of whom all men were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be generated. But this Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence contradicts not our Poſition: Yea, tho' it ſeems to ſay ſomething, yet in very deed it ſays nothing. For when they ſay that all men were not hid in Chriſt, as they were hid in <hi>Adam;</hi> I deſire to know what they mean here by the Word <hi>hid?</hi> Do they mean that all men were ſo hid in <hi>Adam</hi> as things are ſhut up in a Hutch? Then I readily confeſs that all men were not ſo in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48714:73"/>Chriſt: And if this be their meaning of the Word <hi>hid</hi> here; then I ſay, that it is impoſſible that all men ſhould be made Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, becauſe there would then be no more fellowſhip betwixt <hi>Adam</hi> and his Succeſſors then there is betwixt the Cheſt and the things that are therein lockt up: But if by the Word <hi>hid,</hi> they mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe here (as it cannot here ſignifie any thing elſe) but that all men bein derived from <hi>Adam</hi> as from their Stem or Root, are Partakers of his Life, juſt as the Tree and all its Fruit were hid in the Seed, that is, that the Life of the Tree and its Fruit was in the Life of the Seed, and ſo that they have fellowſhip with each other, with reſpect to their Spiritual Being, which is the Former and Maker of the Body, (as is proved in the <hi>Conſiderations concerning Man,</hi> §. 13.34, 35, 36, 37.) then it will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſie for us to prove, that the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt could paſs over unto all men in the ſame manner as the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> did to all his poſterity, that is to ſay: If Chriſt did take upon him the Manhood of <hi>Adam,</hi> which is here the Queſtion; For ſeing that all men are deſcended of <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo are a part of him, as belonging to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do partake of his Life (juſt as all that which is brought forth in this
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48714:74"/>world, remains always apart of this World, it ſeems to ſubſiſt of it ſelf) it is certain, that they always remain a part of <hi>Adam,</hi> and have fellowſhip with him, altho' they ſeem to ſubſiſt of themſelves, becauſe the Life which they have received from <hi>Adam,</hi> which life being once taken away, they could ſubſiſt no longer, becauſe their life is rooted in <hi>Adams</hi> Life: This being ſo (as it is no otherwiſe throughout the whole frame of Nature) that the Producer, and the Produced are in a continual fellowſhip, becauſe the one partakes of the life of the other) I ſay, that ſeing Chriſt did take upon him the Manhood of <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo obtained Righteouſneſs for <hi>Adam,</hi> he alſo obtained Righteouſneſs for all <hi>Adams</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, as they being the Parts of <hi>Adam,</hi> altho' they do not yet all actually feel it, yea tho' the greateſt part of them depart from Chriſt, and lye ſunk and drownd in all manner of ungodlineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> III. But it will again be alledged here: that all men do now ſubſiſt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and conſequently, that men are not therefore ſaved; becauſe Chriſt hath taken upon him <hi>Adams</hi> Manhood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This Objection conſiſts more
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48714:74"/>in Words that ſignifie nothing, than in truth. For what do they mean by <hi>all mens ſubſiſting now of themſelves?</hi> Is this their meaning, that all men are now brought forth without Generation? Or that being begotten and brought forth by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, they are arrived to thoſe Years, and to that growth, that they know how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and to uphold themſelves? This laſt will doubtleſs be the meaning of theſe Words, and not the firſt, becauſe there is no man born into this World but by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which being ſo, it is for ever true, that tho' men can Rule and Govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and in that ſenſe do ſubſiſt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that nevertheleſs every man hath his beginning of being a man, from his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and ſo does continually remain a part of his Parents, with reſpect to his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Being, for if that life which he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from his Parents ſhould fail, his Body would Periſh; and ſo <hi>Adam</hi> being the Stem or Root from whence all men are deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and which conſequently do retain in them continually a part of <hi>Adam;</hi> it is very eaſie to underſtand, that when <hi>Adam</hi> receives again the Image of God, that his Poſterity are thereby put into a capacity of receiving the Image of God again, by vertue of their Fellowſhip with <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="134" facs="tcp:48714:75"/>
            <p>Beſides, when they ſay, that it is not needful, that Chriſt ſhould take upon him the Manhood of <hi>Adam,</hi> that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore unto all men the injoyment of the Image of God, becauſe there were thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of men ſubſiſting of themſelves at the time of Chriſts Incarnation. I anſwer, That if thouſands do ſubſiſt of themſelves, then Chriſt could not ſatisfy for them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not then have had any Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with them, and therefore could not by his Death have reconciled the World to God: But that he muſt have taken upon him the Manhood of ſo many men, as he ſhould have reconciled unto God, and ſo have ſuffered and dyed as oft as there are men upon the Earth, becauſe nothing can be bettered, except the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and the reſtored be united according to §. 76.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> IV. But here again this Evaſion will be made uſe of, <hi>Viz.</hi> That Chriſt could obtain Salvation for ſo many men, becauſe he is the Son of God, who is ſo mighty, that he could by his Spirit bring many Children to Salvation, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that it was not needful that he ſhould take upon him <hi>Adams</hi> Manhood as the Root from whence all mankind is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, that he might thereby unite all mankind to God again.</p>
            <pb n="135" facs="tcp:48714:75"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> To this evaſion I anſwer, That it is indeed true, that Chriſt is ſo mighty, that being the Creator of man he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore men again to the ſtate of Integrity by his Spirit, and this we have our ſelves proved §. 68.69, &amp;c. But that's not the Queſtion here, who it is that alone can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore man; but we are here enquiring on what manner, and by what means or way Chriſt could reſtore Sinners as may be ſeen from §. 76. Now the Means to reunite ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to the Image of God again, I ſay, is that Chriſt ſhould take upon him manhood, as is proved §. 77. therefore we are here only to conſider: whether this means, that is, whether that Manhood, which Chriſt did take upon him, be a fit means, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all men could be united again to the Image of God or no? Therefore this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception has here no place, and this our anſwer might very well ſuffice.</p>
            <p>But to diſcuſs this Shift a little more narrowly, I ſay, that if Chriſt has imparted Salvation unto all Mankind only in vertue of his Spiritual, and Divine being, then he needed not to have become man and to have ſuffered death, and that Chriſts beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming man would then have been utterly needleſs and of no advantage unto ſinners, becauſe Chriſt had that his Divine power,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48714:76"/>before he became man, and did not receive it by his becoming man.</p>
            <p>But if they will ſay, that Chriſt, as he Saviour was to become man (as we our ſelves have proved the neceſſity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of §. 76.77.) I ask ſuch, what Advantage Chriſts becoming man has effected? And whether Chriſt, by becoming man, could reconcile all men, if he had not taken upon him the Manhood of <hi>Adam</hi> as the Stem or Root of all Mankind? the contrary of which we have juſt now ſhewed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> V. But againſt this Poſition: that Chriſt muſt needs have taken upon him <hi>Adams</hi> Manhood, to reunite all men to the the Image of God again; this Objection will ſtill be made, <hi>Viz.</hi> That if Chriſt had taken upon him <hi>Adams</hi> Manhood, and ſo had united <hi>Adam</hi> again with the Image of God, he ſhould at the ſame time have alſo united all men with the Image of God; becauſe they are the Parts of <hi>Adam,</hi> as we our ſelves have affirmed in anſwer to the former Objection, and yet we ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than that all Men are one with the Image of God, but daily experience ſhews us the contrary, and conſeque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tly that it ſeems to no purpoſe, that Chriſt ſhould have taken upon him the Manhood of <hi>Adam</hi> more than that of any other Man.</p>
            <pb n="137" facs="tcp:48714:76"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> But this Objection diſcovers more the Objectors ignorance of the Order of Nature, than any real Contradiction; for Example, is it not evident from Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that the Fruit of a Woman with Child is a part of her? Verily yes, becauſe ſhe does ſome times change the form there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the Womb; wherefore her life has the direction over the Life of her Fruit, while it is in the Womb; But when ſhe has brought forth her Chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, then ſhe has no longer power to change her Child ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her paſſion; but then the Child ſtands upon its own bottom; and its own life muſt preſerve it ſo as that it has then received an own out-working, But altho Children, and Aged People have an out working, yet they do not therefore ceaſe to be a part of their Parents; and conſequently do always retain an Union with them, altho' they do alſo ſtand upon their own bottom (for theſe two things muſt be well minded here, to wit, that they have their Corporeal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Parents, and ſo far are a part of them, as <hi>Adam</hi> ſaid of <hi>Eve, She is Bone of my Bones,</hi> &amp;c. and yet that they alſo have their own out-working) becauſe they are always in Union with their Parents, and yet have a power to Work of their own,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48714:77"/>according to §. 27. Yet they cannot come into that ſtate of their Parents, altho' they do partake of their bodily Being, unleſs their own out-working do incline to come into the ſame ſtate, in which their Parents are: As for Example, when the Apoſtle ſaith 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving Husband is Sanctified by the Wife, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving Wife is Sanctified by the Husband:</hi> Does he here ſignifie, that when the Unbelievers are Sanctified by their believing Husbands or Wives, that they do thereby become Believers, or does he only ſignifie thereby, that when two are become one Fleſh, and ſo do enjoy each others Spirit through love, the Unbeliever becomes Sanctified through that Spiritual Fellowſhip, which they have one with another; that is, That the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever receives by the Spirit of the Believer who is his Co-partner, a Capacity or meet occaſion of becoming a Believer, if he does alſo co-operate thereunto, but not elſe? In like manner when the Apoſtle ſaith, in the ſame Verſe, <hi>That the Children are Holy</hi> which are born of a Believing Father or Mother; does he mean that the Children do thereby become Believers? ſurely no, for that would contradict all Senſe and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: For do we not ſee, that the Faithful <hi>Abraham</hi> had an unbelieving <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> as well as a believing <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48714:77"/>
               <hi>Iſaac</hi> had as well an <hi>Eſau</hi> as a <hi>Jacob?</hi> But the Apoſtle ſignifies thereby, that there is in them a Seed, Beginning or Principle of coming to the Faith, but yet that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or Seed never brings forth Fruit, if they themſelves do not join unto it, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate with it; juſt thus it is now with <hi>Adam</hi> and his Poſterity; that Participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they have of <hi>Adam,</hi> gives unto all Men by vertue of that Union, which they have with <hi>Adam,</hi> that they are ſo far Co-partners of the Divine Image, in ſo much and as far as they are a part of <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo have the ſeed or Principle, that the Image of God can Work in them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as they have their own out-working, (for which reaſon alſo Faith unto Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is required of every one) ſo they do not feel the Working of the Image of God in them, till their own out-working, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire inclines thereunto, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Image of God may Rule in them inſtead of their own Carnal Drivings, Luſts, and Self Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which do (as long as they bear Rule in them) hinder the Spirit of Chriſt from bringing forth Fruits in them, altho' their Origine, to wit, <hi>Adam</hi> be actually and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually reunited unto the Image of God again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> VI. But it will here again be
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48714:78"/>Objected: That Chriſt, as to his humane Nature or Manhood was without Sin, but that <hi>Adam</hi> was ſinful, and that therefore, if Chriſt had taken upon him <hi>Adams</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood he could not have been without Sin, but would therein have alſo partaken of <hi>Adams</hi> Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> True it is, that <hi>Adam</hi> was a Sinner, but that it is alſo true, that Chriſt took not <hi>Adams</hi> Manhood on him till after <hi>Adams</hi> death, <hi>viz.</hi> About four thouſand years after his Creation, ſo that <hi>Adam</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and dyed before Chriſt was united unto <hi>Adams</hi> Manhood. Now becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can become better, but by Suffering and dying according to §. 66.67. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Adam</hi> did Suffer and dye, it does not neceſſarily follow, that becauſe Chriſt took upon him <hi>Adams</hi> Manhood, that therefore he muſt take upon him alſo his Sin, and ſo would not be without ſin the more, becauſe Chriſt was born neither according to the Will of the Fleſh, nor according to the Will of Man, and conſequently had not the principle of Sin in him.</p>
            <p n="79">§. 79. Seing then that Chriſt did take upon him the Manhood of <hi>Adam</hi> that ſo he might thereby redeem Sinners from their ſins, <hi>It was alſo neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer that for Sinners, by which they were to beamended.</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:48714:78"/>Now this amendment was to be through death, as it is ſaid <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou ſhalt dye,</hi> and Rom. 5.12. <hi>By Sin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Verily no Father will Puniſh his Child, nor any equal Judge a Tranſgreſſor, but with intent to Frighten him from his Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to make him the better for it. If then a Worldly Judge does by Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, aim at the reclaiming of Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors from their evil ways, how much more then ſhall the moſt perfect Being which is Righteouſneſs it ſelf, by puniſhing ſinners deſign their amendment, and the making <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Soul or Life of Man.</head>
            <p n="80">§. 80. AS Man in the ſtate wherein he was Created by God, had in him the Divine Image, ſo God alſo beſtowed upon him a <hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>Life,</hi> which differs from the Image of God, and cannot be taken for one and the ſame Eſſence. For if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Properties of the Spirit, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Image, and what excellent Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives and Advantages it affords Man, as hath been ſhewed §. 53, 54, 55, and 56. and on the other hand reflect how few at this day are poſſeſſed of the Image of God, tho' they have a Soul or Life; we ſhall not need any other Argument beſides that of daily Experience to convince us, that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48714:80"/>the Spirit or Image of God differs from the Soul or Life of Man, according to what hath been declared §. 39.</p>
            <p n="81">§. 81. In order therefore to our being informed what the Soul of Man is, it will be neceſſary to enquire into the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it.</p>
            <p>Now the Properties of the Soul are, that it Reaſoneth or Diſcourſeth, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth, Willeth is ſelf-Conſcious, and as long as it is joined to the Body doth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and continually guide and govern the ſame, according to its Will, and the like. That theſe are the properties of the Soul every one finds in himſelf, and is conſcious of it, if he be conſiderative and reflects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own Actions. For as to Bodies they can neither Diſcourſe nor move them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as is viſible in dead Cankaſſes: So that theſe forementioned Qualities are no Properties of the Body, but of the Soul; becauſe when the Soul Operates no longer in the Body, theſe Properties ceaſe alſo.</p>
            <p n="82">§. 82. In Order therefore to make ſome Diſcovery of the Nature of the Soul from theſe its Properties; it will be neceſſary that we conſider every one of them apart, that ſo from theſe we may be able to inferr or conclude what kind of Eſſence that is
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48714:80"/>from whence they flow: For as a Tree is known by his Fruit, ſo may other things be known by their Effects.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Place then, <hi>The Property of the Soul is that She Diſcourſeth and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands,</hi> that is, that the things that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with her, or repreſented to her from without, are conſidered or weighed by her, whether they be Good or Evil, to her Profit or Loſs, and ſuch like. Moreover, thoſe things whereof the Soul Reaſoneth or Diſcourſeth, muſt be either throughly known to her, or in part, for of things ſhe is altogether ignorant of, ſhe cannot Diſcourſe at all. And if the things ſhe Diſcourſeth about, be either throughly, or in Part known by her, then hath ſhe alſo a Comprehenſion or Underſtanding of them, and what ſhe doth Comprehend ſhe hath alſo an Image or Idea of, as hath been ſhewed §. 15. Now this Image or Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, and the Souls conſidering and Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the ſame, takes up no Room at all in her; becauſe a man comprehends many thouſands of things without encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bulk of his Body, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the things he comprehends be much greater than it. Whence it is evident, that Reaſoning, and Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding take up no ſpace, how great or ample ſoever the thing may be that is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48714:81"/>or underſtood. But on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that the Underſtanding can comprehend great things as well as little, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that ſhe is neither great nor little: Now that which is neither great nor ſmall, and yet comprehends things great and ſmall, cannot be Corporeal but Spiritual, foraſmuch as all Bodies are either great or ſmall. What hath been ſaid here of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning or Underſtanding, the ſame may be ſaid of the other Properties; For <hi>to be ſelf conſcious,</hi> is to reflect and be convinced that we have done or omitted theſe or the the other things. Now this Conviction is not any thing that is Bodily, but a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Being, becauſe there can be no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction without a Comprehenſion or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Matter we are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of: So likewiſe that Property of the Soul, whereby ſhe ſupports <hi>or upholds the Body</hi> as well as <hi>guides and directs it,</hi> is not Bodily but Spiritual. For this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pholding</hi> conſiſts in preſerving of the Body in its Priſtine Form and State, which Action of Preſervation, cannot be Corporeal, becauſe it includes a Superintendence or Direction whereby Nouriſhment and Support is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to every Member according to their different ſtate and requiring. And this direction is the Beginning and Principal thing in the upholding or Support of the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48714:81"/>Body. For tho' many Bodies ſhould be join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together all manner of ways, yet will they never be able to ſupport or uphold one another, ſo that the Direction where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our Food is prepared, and tranſmuted in ſuch a manner, that our Body is fed and maintained by it, is not any thing that is Corporeal but Spiritual. Of which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or Superintendence we have treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at large in our <hi>Obſervations concerning Man,</hi> §. 34.35, 36, 37, 38, 39. And as this Direction which Superintends the Nouriſhment and Support of the Body is Spiritual, ſo likewiſe is the Guiding and Governing of the Body Spiritual alſo, for as much as it proceeds from the Will, and is immediatly effected or executed in the Body at the ſame inſtant that the Soul or Life wills and thinks it. Which is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Argument that this Rule or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance muſt needs be Spiritual and not Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, for as much as not the leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time Intervenes between the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or Command of the Will, and its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, which could never be if the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency or Operation of the Will were Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal. But of this Direction of the Body ſee the foreſaid <hi>Obſervations concerning Man</hi> §. 91.</p>
            <p n="83">§. 83. Seing therefore that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48714:82"/>of the Soul are not Corporeal but Spiritual, it follows that the <hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>Life,</hi> is a <hi>Spirit</hi> and no Body, becauſe all her Properties are Spiritual. Now that the Life is a Spirit, I have demonſtrated in the foreſaid <hi>Obſervations.</hi> §. 34.35, 36, 37.</p>
            <p n="84">§. 84. The <hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>Life</hi> therefore being a Spirit cannot die, or be changed, as Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are: For when we ſay that Bodies are <hi>changed</hi> this imports an Increaſe or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of thoſe parts that before were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And to Die implies nothing elſe but this, that the Bodies are no longer maintained in the form and condition they were in before, but are Subject to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration. So that all Dying includes a Change or alteration, (of which ſee the <hi>Conſiderations concerning Man,</hi> §. 32.) Now certain it is that whatſoever changeth its form or appearance, doth include Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, whereby the parts that before were united, are now ſeparated from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and whatſoever is ſubject to Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, muſt be a Body, becauſe Diviſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is the Property of Bodies which conſiſt of many Parts. And foraſmuch as accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to §. 83. the Soul is a Spirit, therefore neither can the Soul die or be divided, or ever change its Eſſence.</p>
            <p>If any one Object here, that ſhe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48714:82"/>changeth her operations, and by this means grows either better or worſe, and that this change is a kind of Dying; this we are very willing to grant, as long as by this Word, Change, or Dying, is not meant or underſtood that the Eſſence of the Soul dies, in like manner as Bodies do; but only this, that the Soul being Conſcious of her evil Deeds, repents of, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers for them, and by this means becomes changed in her Operations, or manner of Acting All this we readily grant, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving plainly aſſerted the ſame concerning all Lives, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are meliorated by Suffering, §. 66. and in the <hi>Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about Man,</hi> §. 32. in theſe Words, <hi>Or that the Life for a time ceaſeth from its Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bringing forth Fruit, by which ceſſation of her Activity, ſhe either changeth her Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or brings forth better Fruit then before,</hi> &amp;c. But ſuch a change or dying as this with regard to the Soul, doth not in the leaſt import that her Eſſence is changed or divided as that of Bodies is, when their Forms are changed.</p>
            <p n="85">§. 85. And for as much as the Soul, with reſpect to her Eſſence, is Unchangeable and Immortal, ſo <hi>neither can ſhe be Annihilated,</hi> becauſe no Annihilation can be without dying, ſeing that every thing as long as it
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48714:83"/>lives hath its Eſſence, and conſequently is not Annihilated, or reduced to nothing. And for as much as the Soul Lives continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally according to §. 84. conſequently it cannot be Annihilated: For ſeing that all things are ever preſent to God as in §. 14. it follows that the Soul cannot be Annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe the Annihilation of a thing, is that whereby it ceaſeth to be, or is the reducing of a thing to nothing: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Eſſence of the Soul could be Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated, then all beings could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually preſent to God; but more Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would be preſent to him at one time then at another, which is repugnant to the Divine Attributes, according to §. 14, 15. For as much therefore, as all Beings are perpetually preſent to God, if follows, that the <hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>Life</hi> cannot be Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated.</p>
            <p>Moreover, ſeing that all Beings are in God without beginning, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently have neither beginning nor end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as hath been demonſtrated §. 24.25, 26. therefore it follows that the Soul hath no end.</p>
            <p>And when we conſider that the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality of Bodies cannot be Annihilated, tho' their form be changed, becauſe they were not produced out of nothing, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to §. 27. and in the <hi>Obſervations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48714:83"/>Man</hi> §. 32. how much leſs can the Soul which is not ſubject to Mutation, as Bodies are, being a Spirit) be obnoxious to Annihilation? Eſpecially if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that ſhe is the Framer of the Body, as in the foreſaid <hi>Obſervations</hi> in §. 37 38. hath been ſhewed. For my part, I confeſs that it is altogether inconceivable to me, how any thing that is Eſſential ſhould looſe its Being and become nothing; and they that Imagine ſuch a thing do not know what Annihilation imports; only they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the Soul dies liek a Body, that is ſeparated into its parts (the contrary whereof hath been made out § 84.) and this is that they call Annihilation. For as to that which Annihilation properly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, thereof they can frame no image or apprehenſion, for otherwiſe they would have an apprehenſion of nothing: For An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation ſignifies the turning of a thing to nothing.</p>
            <p>But ſome perhaps will ſay, true it is that the Being of a Soul is not Annihilated; but that the Soul when the Body dyes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to the Univerſal Spirit, But firſt we are to conſider what is meant by the Univerſal Spirit, for if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they underſtood the Divine Eſſence, as if Souls were a part thereof: this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the Reaſon alledged §. 4. and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48714:84"/>more eſpecially becauſe the Soul is mutable as to its Thoughts, Will and Works; whereas the Divine Eſſence is unchangeable in all theſe, as is ſhewed §. 24.</p>
            <p>If by the Univerſal Spirit they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Eſſence of the World, neither is that poſſible, becauſe this ſuppoſed, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits would be Diviſible; which cannot be, as hath been ſhewed §. 83.84. becauſe the Soul is a Spirit, and therefore not ſubject to partibility.</p>
            <p n="86">§ 86. For as much then, as it follows from the Attributes of God, that the Soul cannot be Annihilated, becauſe ſhe hath been without beginning in God, we may by the ſame conſequence conclude, that ſhe is not Created out of nothing: For to Create a thing out of Nothing imports, that the thing Created did receive the firſt beginning of its Being in that Creation, but this cannot be, becauſe all Souls have been without beginning in God, and therefore before the Creation, as may be ſeen §. 24.25, 27. Where the Creation is treated of, and where it is ſhewed what Creation doth import or ſignify, and what not.</p>
            <p n="87">§. 87. Seing therefore that Souls are without beginning, we are to underſtand and take Notice, <hi>That all the Souls that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the World, were in the Creation at once, and altogether Created God:</hi> That
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48714:84"/>is, Souls were put in ſuch a ſtate or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Creation, that they might ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due what is Tangible, and Viſible, and have Dominion over it; for that the word <hi>to Create,</hi> can in no wiſe ſignifie the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of a thing out of nothing, hath been abundantly ſhewed in §. 27.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>that all Beings appertaining to this world muſt have been Created at once in the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is a conſequence deducible from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom,</hi> as hat been ſhewed §. 30.31. and have alſo demonſtrated the ſame at large from the Nature of the Creation, §. 32. And for as much as the Soul belongs to man, and Man is a part of the World, therefore it neceſſarily follows, that all Souls were Created by God at once in the Creation.</p>
            <p n="88">§. 88. But to evidence the Impoſſibility of Gods Creating new Souls every day, we will enquire a little what Abſurdities do inevitably follow upon this Poſition, that God Creates the Soul in the Body at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of Generation.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore, if God daily Creates Souls, I would demand of thoſe who grant according to the Holy Scriptures, that we all ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> how according to their ſuppoſal of Gods daily Creating Souls, there can be any Truth, or ſo much as any poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48714:85"/>in this Aſſertion. For is it not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that man conſiſts not only of a Body, but alſo of a Soul? And is it not of equal Truth, that the Soul is much more worthy, and excellent than the Body, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe is immortal and doth govern the Body, purſuant to her Will and Thoughts? §. 81.82, 84. Seing therefore the Man conſiſts, not only of a Body, but alſo of a Soul, and that the Soul is much more excellent than the Body, and the ſame which thinks, deſires, or luſts, and that luſt or Concupiſcence is the firſt Riſe of Sin. The Query is therefore, if ſo be all Men have ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> and are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers with him in his ſin; whether I ſay, if this be ſo, all Souls muſt not of neceſſity have been in <hi>Adam,</hi> for as much as they are the moſt Excellent, and by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the moſt valuable Parts of Man, and the Governours of the Body?</p>
            <p>If any one ſay, that it is not neceſſary that all Souls ſhould have been in <hi>Adam,</hi> at that time that he Sinned; for that God hath imputed the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> to his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, becauſe they all as to their Bodies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from him. But I would demand of thoſe what Reaſonableneſs or Equity there would be in this, if God, in Creating Souls, ſhould make them ſinful; for the souls of <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity could not ſin, nor
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48714:85"/>conſent to his ſin, becauſe according to their Opinion they were not yet Created; and therefore cannot be now Created ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, by an imaginary Imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin. Neither do thoſe who Preach theſe deviſed Fables, ever conſider how repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant the ſame is to the Eſſence of God. For what will become of the Divine Juſtice, if God puniſheth men for a ſin which was committed ſome thouſands of Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever they were Created, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently could not be guilty of, or acceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the ſame? That this is abſolutely inconſiſtent with Gods Juſtice, ſee §. 35.</p>
            <p>But perhhaps it will be ſaid that Souls are therefore Created ſinful by God, becauſe they are to be joined to aſinful Body, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from <hi>Adam.</hi> But let theſe ſhew me the leaſt ſhadow or appearance of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon there is in this Conſequence, <hi>viz.</hi> That God Creates Souls ſinful, becauſe the Bodies to which they are to be joined are ſo. For my part, I boldly aſſert, that no man will ever be able to give me any Reaſon coherent in all its parts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Divive Wiſdom, why the Chiefeſt part of Man ſhould be made ſinful, becauſe the Inferior and ſervile part is ſo. But ſuppoſe we ſhould grant them this their abſurd Poſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That Souls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48714:86"/>of the Sinful Bodies to which they muſt be joined, have ſin imputed to them by God, and are therefore Created ſinful; yet I further demand of them, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon there is, why the Souls when they are firſt Created, at the inſtant of Generation, are thruſt into ſinful Bodies? Or what Communion or Felloſhip they can have with ſuch ſinful Bodies? Seing that they never committed any ſin? Will they ſay that God would have it ſo? Then it muſt follow from hence, that as ſoon as God hath Created a ſinleſs Soul, his Will and Pleaſure is immediatly to ſend it into a ſinful Body. But what Reaſonableneſs or Equity would there be in this, that God ſhould puniſh a Soul and make it ſinful by Imputation, before ever it had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any ſin, and this meerly for the ſinful Bodies ſake in which ſhe is to dwell? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over when they ſay that <hi>God doth not beſtow this Perfection upon Souls in their Creation, becauſe of the imputation of Adams Sin?</hi> Do not they hereby intimate, that God doth not Create Souls perfect. <hi>viz.</hi> So as <hi>Adams</hi> Soul was Created, for this muſt be their meaning, when they ſay that God now Creates Souls perverſe (for imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is the ſame as perverſe,) but why then do they tell us upon other occaſions,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48714:86"/>that whatſoever God Creates is very good, and that God is not the Author of ſin? For theſe things are contradictory to one another, and by this means the Divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes are made to oppoſe and claſh againſt one another.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, when they aſſert, that the Souls are then firſt Created when their Bodies are Generated by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; what ſhadow of Wiſdom or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is there in this, that whereas the Souls are Created at once, and all alike, that one Soul ſhould be thruſt into a Beggars Body, or into ſome other more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Circumſtantiated Lodging, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advanced to a Royal State and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by means of the Body to which it is preferred; that one ſhould be Born of Good, and another of Bad Parents, when yet in worthineſs they are all of them equal, and all of them alike pure and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſs? Will they ſay that God does this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ccording to his Free-will, and that he may and can thus differrently diſpoſe of Souls at his good pleaſure? But indeed we ſhall find the quite contrary when we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ome to examine this matter, and that God neither will nor can do any ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hing, as hath been ſhewed §. 22 and 36.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If it be ſo that the Soul is
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48714:87"/>Created when the Body is begotten, then it will follow, that when the Act of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is performed in Whoredom, or Adultery, that God muſt Create a Soul for the Body ſo Generated, and ſo the Creation of the Soul will depend on the Generation of Men, becauſe the Soul ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them, is never Created but at the Generation of the Body.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Seing that the Body is Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the Parents, and conſequently muſt have been in Being before it was Generated; for as much as the leaſt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is not now produced, the Eſſentiality whereof was not in the Creation, no reaſon can be alledged, why God ſhould not as well have Created the Souls of Men in the beginning, as that which is corporeal.</p>
            <p>But then it will be asked, where were then all thoſe Souls that were Created to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Creation, ſeing they had not yet any Bodies of their own? To which I anſwer, that they were all in <hi>Adam</hi> as in their firſt Parent from hom they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards came forth. But this will b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thought very ſtrange, that ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Souls ſhould be in one Man Ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is not this at all impoſſible, for how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand Images of men and othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:48714:87"/>thing have we within us that we have ſeen. Now all theſe Images that we have received from abroad are likewiſe Spiritual Beings (as hath been ſhewed in the <hi>Obſervations about Man</hi> §. 44.45) and yet they take up no ſpace in us. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a man may have Millions of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Beings or Images in him, in like manner he is capable alſo of having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands of Souls in him, becauſe they alſo are Spiritual Beings, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take up no Room in him, all which Souls by Means of Generation, are as it were wrought out from him, or brought forth to outward Manifeſtation in diſtinct Bodies and times. And to make this more clear by an Example, we ſee that a Tree brings forth its Fruit every Year, which it could not do, if the Life and Eſſence of thoſe Fruits had not been in the Tree before their Production: ſo that this Life lies ſo long hid in the Tree, then till, according to the Order of Nature, the time of bringing for Fruit be come.</p>
            <p n="89">§. 89. And for as much as from §. 87. it is evident that Souls were Created altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by God in the Creation, this likewiſe overthrows that Poſition, which aſſerts <hi>That the Souls of Men are Generated by the Parents,</hi>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:48714:88"/>viz. After the ſame manner as the Body is: For as in Generation ſome part of the Corporeal Subſtance goes away from the Parents, ſo if they were Generators of the Soul, as well as of the Body, they would looſe ſome part of their Souls in the Act of Generation, which is impoſſible, for that the Soul being a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, according to §. 83.84 muſt conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be indiviſible.</p>
            <p n="90">§ 90. Seing therefore, that the Soul or Life doth uphold and form its own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as hath been ſhewed §. 82. and hath exiſted together with it in the Creation § 87. and conſequently proceeds from one and the ſame beginning with it, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>That the Soul muſt conſiſt of the ſame Principles, whence the Body takes its Original.</hi> For if the Soul did not conſiſt of the very ſame Principles whence the Eſſence of the Body doth proceed, ſhe could never have any Communion or Fellowſhip with the Body, becauſe <hi>two things of a different Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal can never unite or Co-operate,</hi> except it be by means of a third that partakes of both their Eſſences.</p>
            <p>Moreover, for as much as Souls were in the Creation, as well as Bodies, and that whatſoever was in the Creation, did proceed from one only, it follows that the Soul
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48714:88"/>muſt conſiſt of the ſame Principles whence the Body took its Original. Now Bodies conſiſt of two things, <hi>Viz.</hi> Fire and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and this Fire and Water are Spiritual Beings in their beginning or Principles whence they proceed, as hath been ſhewed at large in the <hi>Obſervations concerning Man,</hi> from § 7. to 21. And therefore we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the Soul conſiſts of a Spiritual, Fiery, and Watery Eſſence.</p>
            <p>And that the Soul conſiſts of theſe two, we may be further informed from hence, that the Soul in Scripture is alſo called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Breath,</hi> as is ſhewed §. 47. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. it is ſaid that <hi>God Breathed into his</hi> (Adams) <hi>noſtris the Breath of Life,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is intimated that the Life or Soul doth enjoy, and make uſe of Breath or Aire, for the upholding, and ſupport of its Actions or Operations, as every one in himſelf doth experience, that without taking of Breath or Reſpiration, his Soul or life cannot maintain or preſerve the Body; as is ſhewed at large in the <hi>Conſider ations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Man</hi> § 62.63, 64, and 68. If ſo be therefore, that the Soul it ſelf, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called Breath, and doth enjoy, or make uſe of Breath or Air, for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of her Body, conſequently the Soul muſt partake with the Air, and proceed from the ſame beginning as it doth. Now
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48714:89"/>it is certain that the Air conſiſts of a Fiery and Watery Eſſence, as in the ſaid <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations</hi> § 65. hath been ſhewed.</p>
            <p>But againſt this it will be objected that if the Soul Conſiſts of the ſame Principles, whence the Body Originally came forth, then it is not impoſſible but that the Soul may become Corporeal. To which Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection I anſwer, Firſt, that it is no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequence, becauſe the Soul and Body proceed from the ſame Principles, that therefore the Soul may become Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: As will appear from this Example, Gold and Iron proceed from the ſame Principles, but yet we cannot conclude from hence, that Gold can be changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Iron; becauſe Gold is advanced to that degree of Perfection, that it always abides Gold, to which Iron hath not yet attained, and therefore is ſubject to Ruſt, and turns to earth again. But the Perfection of Gold appears in this, that it endures the Fire without loſs or diminution, which Iron doth not, but is burnt and conſumed by it. Yet on the other hand it is true alſo (that is, Reaſon teacheth us, and it muſt be true in Nature, tho' we cannot give an ocular Demonſtration of it) that ſeing Iron con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of the ſame Principles as Gold doth, it can alſo arive, through manifold dying, and ſuffering, to the ſame degree of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48714:89"/>which Gold hath. And the ſame may be ſaid concerning the Soul and that which is Bodily, that tho' they both proceed from the ſame Principles, yet doth it not follow therefore, that the Soul can become Corporeal, becauſe ſhe is arrived to that perfection which renders her indiviſible and unchangeable in her Eſſence. Tho' it be a true Conſequence that the Body for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it conſiſts of the ſame Principles as the Soul doth, that it may arrive to that degree of Perfection as to become Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, if ſo be the Soul or Life could become Corporeal, then might all things in time come to be dead, and without any Operation at all; which can never be, becauſe God hath brought forth all things in Order, ſo that all things muſt be wrought out, that is, brought forth to manifeſtation according to due Order, (which cannot be done without activity) and not always continue dead and depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all Efficiency.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if the Life of every thing could become Bodily, then the Creatures might bring forth young of a different kind from themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> Sheep might bring forth Birds, and Men Sheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For there is no difference in Bodies but what they derive from their Life, which according to its
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48714:90"/>peculiar Efficiency and Property doth form its own Body. Beſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, if the Life of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Creature could become Corporeal, then all of them would have the ſame Fleſh and Form, foraſmuch as they partake of the ſame Nouriſhment; but nature teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That each kind hath its own Form and Fleſh, whence it is evident that each kind doth unchangeably retain its own Life, as hath been ſhewed in the <hi>Obſervations concerning Man,</hi> §. 33.</p>
            <p>But ſome will object, if the Soul of Man conſiſts of the ſame Principles, whence the Life of other Creatures is derived, what Perfection then hath man more then they? to which I anſwer, that tho' all lives pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the ſame Principles, yet do they differ in their Efficiency and Perfection: for all Creatures have not the ſame under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Wiſdom: And what Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath more Wiſdom then Man, who can rule all Creatures? Beſides Man hath this Prerogative alſo above all Creatures, who is made according to the Image of God, of which ſee Chapter <hi>2d.</hi> and the <hi>Obſervations concerning Man,</hi> §. 46.47. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="91">§. 91. Seing therefore that the Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of the ſame Principles with the Body, whence may be underſtood, that the Soul
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48714:90"/>can work on the Body, ſo from the ſame head we may gather, <hi>how the Soul my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Sinful:</hi> as ſhall be ſhewed when we come to treat of the Fall of Man.</p>
            <p>Only thus much I ſhall ſay here by the by, that it will be impoſſible for any Man ever to make out, how the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oul is become ſinful, ſave only by this way: And becauſe men know little of the Nature, and Eſſence of things, therefore it is that they torment and vex themſelves with that old and long bandied Queſtion, how or by what means the Soul is become ſinful.</p>
            <p n="92">§ 92. But ſome Perhaps will Query, <hi>Seing that the Soul is become ſinful, by what means can ſhe be delivered from ſin?</hi> To which we anſwer, that the Soul may be meliorated, by recovering of the Image of God as hath been ſhewed at large §. 61.62, 63. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The means whereby we may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to this Melioration, and recover the Image of God, ſhall be ſhewed in the ſequel.</p>
            <p n="93">§. 93.

            <p n="94">§. 94. WE have ſhewed the neceſſity of the Souls conſiſting of the ſame Principles whence the Body is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; as on the other hand it is as true that Bodies proceed from the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples whereof the Soul conſiſts: and that the Body hath its own proper Life, over and above its being governed by the Soul or its Principal Spirit. For when the Soul or Life doth ceaſe from its former Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that the Body thereupon dies, yet we ſhall find that theſe dead Bodies after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards turn to Worms, &amp;c. Yea experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teacheth us that ſometimes the Hair and Nails of a Dead Body do grow, which proves that the Body hath its own Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Soul or general Life, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48714:91"/>the Body in its form or Eſſence, as long as ſhe continues in her former Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Efficiency.</p>
            <p n="95">§. 95. But ſome will ask why ſince the Body hath its own life, man doth notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſtand in need of a Soul or Life. For anſwer to this, I deſire the Enquirer to conſider, that mans Body being fed by the Creatures, he enjoys and partakes of the Life of them, which Life of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, if it were not tranſmuted in man, ſo as to comply with the Operation or Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of Man it could never be of uſe for the ſupport or preſervation of Man. To the end therefore, that the Creatures and their Life might be for the ſuſtenance of the Bodies of Men, it was neceſſary that man ſhould have his own life, and that the ſaid Life ſhould be Maſter, and diſpoſe of the Life of the Creatures, according to its pleaſure, as a General Governs and Commands his whole Army. Wherefore it is abſolutely neceſſary that man ſhould have a Soul or Life, that may ſuperintend, Rule and Govern all the Lives and Spirits that are in his Body. Of the Soul or Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral Spirit hath been Treated in the <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations concerning Man.</hi> §. 33.51.</p>
            <p n="96">§. 96. Theſe Principles now, whereof
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48714:92"/>the Body, and all Creatures whether Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal or Spiritual do conſiſt, can be no more than two, that is, neither three nor four, for nothing is produced in the whole Univerſe, but from two different Natures, as we find in Fiſhes, Birds, Beaſts, and Men, <hi>viz.</hi> That all Generation is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Male and Female, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening third Principle different from the Male and Female Eſſence. So likewiſe neither Trees, nor any other Vegetables bring forth Fruit, but from the Union of theſe two Principles. For tho' the Sun, Water, Earth, Dung, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Plants and Trees; yet will the Sun, the Water, Earth and Dung, be found to conſiſt only of theſe two Principles, if they be reſolved into their Parts. So that theſe will never conſtitute a third Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, Eſſentially differing from the two former.</p>
            <p n="97">§. 97. Theſe two Principles whereof all Creatures conſiſt, are Fire and Water: And that all Animals and Vegetables con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of a Fiery Eſſence, experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, in that they can be burnt. For the Fire that we make to warm our ſelves by (which is the Fire of the Creatures, mentioned in our <hi>Conſiderations concerning Man,</hi> §. 14.) muſt continually be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48714:92"/>with Wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or elſe it would ceaſe to burn: Wherefore that which is laid upon the Fire for Fewel, muſt have a Fire in it, which is capable of being exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Yea, <hi>it would be altogether impoſſible to make any thing burn if it had not a Fiery Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in it.</hi> That the Creatures have a Fire in them hath been ſhewed in the <hi>Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning Man,</hi> §. 9. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="98">§. 98. And as all Creatures have a Fire in them, ſo their Bodily Principle is Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for <hi>the laſt thing into which Bodies can be reſolved is Water:</hi> And the Water, <hi>viz.</hi> the Heavenly and Spiritual cannot be reduced to another Eſſence, that is, into a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple out of which the ſaid Spiritual Water was produced at firſt, but continues always Water: ſo that the Water is a Principle from whence all Bodies derive their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. Now that all Bodies proceed from water is very evident from this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: A very credible Perſon, and good Friend hath told me, that he had met with a certain Water, which being diſtill'd with a gentle Heat did always produce Sand, which was left at the bottom of the Glaſs, and this notwithſtanding that it had before been Filtred through Paper. So that Nature teacheth us, that Sand hath its Original from Water.</p>
            <pb n="170" facs="tcp:48714:93"/>
            <p>Beſides it is well known that Sand and and stones are of the ſame Nature, and of kin to one another. For experience teacheth us, that many Fiſhes that have their Original from Water, do make Stones, as Oyſters, Cockles and other Shel-Fiſh, whoſe Shells are Stone, as appears in this, that like Limeſtone, they may be burnt into Lime. Neither do theſe Shells grow outwardly or Circumferentially upon them, but from within, for it is obſerved that as the Fiſh increaſeth, ſo the Shell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth alſo. We find alſo in Cockle Shells that are ſpotted, that they increaſe and grow bigger, according as the Cockles themſelves do: Which is an evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that the Shells of Fiſhes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their increaſe or growth from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Life of the Fiſhes to which they belong. Seing therefore that Fiſhes conſiſt of Water, and are nouriſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, their Shells muſt derive their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from the ſame Water, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently this aſſure us, that Stones are the product of Water.</p>
            <p>Nature alſo holds forth the ſame thing to us, for there is a Mountain in <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland,</hi> which gives forth Water from each ſide of it, the one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of makes Stone, and the other waſtes and conſumes it. The ſame is alſo further
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48714:93"/>confirmed by another Operation of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for it hath been found that in ſome Mountains there is found a Water drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping from Stones, which in its dropping down is turned into Stone, whereof ſee further in the <hi>Obſervations concerning Man,</hi> §, 18.19.</p>
            <p>And that all Bodies derive their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from the Water I have alſo ſhewed §. 27. and in my <hi>Obſervations,</hi> &amp;c. §. 7.8.18. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="99">§. 99. Seing that §. 27. it hath been ſaid that all Eſſences of things are ſpiritual, and the product of that which is ſpiritual, it follows that Fire and Water, being the two Principles whereof all Creatures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, they muſt be ſpiritual Beings alſo.</p>
            <p n="100">§. 100. To demonſtrate therefore that Fire is a ſpiritual Being, let us firſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that <hi>Fireis the Life of the Creatures.</hi> For experience teacheth that when any breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Creature dies it turns cold, and is depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the heat and warmth it had when yet alive: Which may convince us, that ſeing the Life, as long as it continues in its Operation doth warm Man, or any other Animal, and ſometimes caſt him into extream heat, it muſt therefore be a Fiery Being.</p>
            <pb n="172" facs="tcp:48714:94"/>
            <p>Moreover, Experience teacheth us, that things that are dead or mortified, as dead or rotten Wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth not afford ſo much Fire, or does not burn ſo well, as Wood that is yet ſound and alive; which is an Argument that the Life of Wood is a Fiery Eſſence.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Man experienceth in himſelf that the warmer he is (provided the Warmth be regular and natural) the more lively and chearful he is alſo, and on the contrary, the colder he is, the leſs fit he is to do any thing. Yea, there is nothing more notorious than that a Man that dies of a lingering Diſeaſe, grows ſtill Colder and Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for proportionably as the Activity or Operativenes of his Life decreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſo the cold encreaſeth, which moſt clearly demonſtrates to us, that the Life is a Fire. The ſame thing is alſo made out in our <hi>Obſervations concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Man,</hi> §. 11.12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="101">§. 101. Seing therefore, that the Fiery Eſſence is the Life of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that the Life hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Limitation nor Extenſion, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Fiery Eſſence muſt be a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48714:94"/>
               <hi>Spirit,</hi> and this we have made out §. 82.83. and in our <hi>Obſervations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Man,</hi> §. 13.34, 35, 36, 37. to which I refer my Reader.</p>
            <p n="102">§. 102. And like as the Fire is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſo is likewiſe the <hi>Watry Eſſence,</hi> which is the other Principle whereof all Creatures conſiſt; according to §. 98. a <hi>Spiritual Eſſence.</hi> For tho' the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Waters be viſible, and Tangible, yet is their Original ſpiritual, becauſe the Waters partake with the Aire, and are one and the ſame Nature, and the Aire doth partake and is in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with an Eſſence that is ſo ſpiritual that it cannot be ſhut out any where, but pierceth through all Bodies, which ſpiritual Eſſence is by the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers called <hi>Aether,</hi> or <hi>Materia Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilis,</hi> which is always in conjunction with the Aire. If therefore the Aire have in it ſuch a ſpiritual Eſſence, it muſt alſo have Communion with the ſame, and therefore muſt be partaker of the Nature of that ſpiritual Eſſence. And as the Air is partaker of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Aether,</hi> ſo likewiſe the Air Communicates with the Inferior Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and this Communication teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48714:95"/>us that the Inferior Waters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their Original from the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Principle as the upper Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do.</p>
            <p>And for as much as the Images which Man ſends forth from himſelf, are Spiritual Beings (as hath been ſhewed in my <hi>Obſervations concerning Man,</hi> §. 44.45.) and no Images can be made of Bodies, it follows that the Bodies from whence Images do proceed, muſt have a ſpiritual Original or Principle and this Principle of Bodies is the Water, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to §. 98. from all which it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Aqueous Eſſence muſt be ſpiritual.</p>
            <p>The Birth of Man alſo teacheth us the ſame thing; for ſeing that every Humane birth muſt firſt be ſpiritual, before it can be corporeal; as hath been ſhewed in my <hi>Obſervations Concerning Man</hi> §. 93.94. And that the Body is formed of the Female or Lunar watry Eſſence, as in the foreſaid <hi>Obſervations,</hi> §. 95. hath been ſhewed: wherefore it follows that the Water in its Original or Principle muſt be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>
            <p>Moreover it is a Fundamental Truth, that <hi>nothing can be ultimately reſolved into any other matter, except that whereof it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt:</hi> When therefore the Scripture tells
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48714:95"/>us, that that which is Bodily, muſt be made ſpiritual, doth not this plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that Bodies proceed from a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Principle?</p>
            <p>If any one ſhould ſay, that when the Scripture ſpeaks of the Body, being made ſpiritual, it doth not intend thereby, that our Bodies ſhould be ſo ſpiritualiz'd as to become inviſible, and to penetrate other Bodies: We dare tell ſuch a one to his face, that he doth not know what it is to be ſpiritual, nor what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth ſignify by that word. Now that the Body may become ſpiritual, as to be inviſible, and to penetrate other Bodies, we may learn from our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, whoſe Body, after his Reſurrection was ſo ſpiritual, that when the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>had ſhut the Doors</hi> upon them for fear of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he notwithſtanding en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and ſtood in the midſt of them, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.19, 26. Which is not ſpecified in Scripture to no purpoſe, but to teach us that our Bodies muſt be made ſpiritual, even as Chriſt had made his ſuch. Not that we are to underſtand here, that Chriſt by vertue of his Divine Nature made his Body thus ſpiritual, for this hath no place here; nor muſt we have recourſe to the Divine Omnipotence: for if there were not a Principle of ſpiritualization,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48714:96"/>or being made ſpiritual in all Bodies, God himſelf would never make Bodies ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Our Saviour therefore was willing to teach us by his ſpiritual Body, that we as being his Members and followers, ſhall obtain ſuch a ſpiritual Body, as ſoon as we are perfectly and wholly dead: And therefore the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.42, 43, 44. That <hi>it</hi> (the Body) <hi>is ſown in Corruption, it is raiſed in Incorruption; it is ſown in diſhonour, it is raiſed in Glory: it is ſown in Weakneſs, it is raiſed in Power; A Natural</hi> (properly Souliſh) <hi>Body is ſown, but it is raiſed a Spiritual Body.</hi> And V. 53. <hi>For this Corruption muſt put on Incorruption; and this Mortal muſt put on Immortality.</hi> Which ways of Expreſſion do plainly intimate to us, that that which is bodily muſt become ſpiritual; and if it can be made ſpiritual, then conſequently its Principle muſt be a ſpiritual Being. That the Water is a ſpiritual Eſſence I have ſhewed in my <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations concerning Man,</hi> § 20.</p>
            <p>But foraſmuch as it hath been ſhewed §. 97.98. That all Creatures conſiſt of a Fiery and Watry Eſſence, and that theſe Eſſences are ſpiritual, according to §. 100.101, 102. It follows that the <hi>Eſſentiality of Bodies cannot be Annihilated:</hi> Becauſe the Eſſentiality from whence Bodies Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally do proceed, hath been in God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48714:96"/>beginning. Of which ſee more §. 24.25, and 85.</p>
            <p n="104">§. 104. Seing therefore tha the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have their Original from theſe two ſpiritual Eſſences, the next thing we are to enquire into is, <hi>What difference there is betwixt the Fiery and Watry Eſſence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It hath been ſhewed §. 100. that Fire is the Life of all Creatures; that is, that which ſupports and upholds them in their Efficiency or Activity: To the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we nay know wherein the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Eſſence differs from the Fiery, it will be neceſſary for us to enquire a little into the nature of the Watry Eſſence.</p>
            <p>It is known by Experience, that the Fire and Water are two Eſſences, that ſtand oppoſite to each other; that is, the Fire Warms, and the Water Cools, ſo that the Water hath a contrary Operation or Efficiency to Fire; for as the Fiery eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence quickens, ſo the Watry kills, or is the Cauſe of Death. And thus much daily Experience teacheth us; for when Cold, which partakes of the nature of the Watry Eſſence, gets the Dominion, and bears ſway, then Death follows.</p>
            <p>Moreover, that the Watry Eſſence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to Reſt, and Death, in oppoſition to the Vivifying Fiery Eſſence, may be
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48714:97"/>hence diſcernible; becauſe the Watry cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Refrigerating Eſſence hath Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the Night, as the Fiery in the Day: This being the Order which God hath eſtabliſhed in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Sun which is a Fiery Being, ſhould Rule or have Dominion over the Day, and the Moon over the Night. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.16. And for as much as the Moon is Refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative or Cooling like the Water, and hath Dominion over the Water, as hath been ſhewed in our <hi>Obſervations concerning Man,</hi> §. 25. Conſequently it muſt be of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Water. Seing therefore that the Moon is of the Watry Eſſence, and hath Dominion over the Night, and that the Night cauſeth Reſt and Sleep, as hath been ſhewed in the aforeſaid <hi>Obſervations,</hi> §. 26. and that Sleep is Death in a leſs degree, as hath been ſhewed in our <hi>Obſervations,</hi> §. 32. from all this I ſay, it follows, that the Watry Eſſence muſt be Operative of ſleep and death.</p>
            <p>From what hath been ſaid we may alſo underſtand the contrary Obſervation of the Water, to that of the Fiery Eſſence: For as Heat and Cold, Life and Death are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to one another; ſo likewiſe is Light and Darkneſs: Now it is evident that Light proceeds from the Fiery Eſſence, and therefore by conſequence, the Watry Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48714:97"/>muſt excite Darkneſs, becauſe Fire and Water are contrary to each other, and therefore we muſt conclude that the contrary Effects of Light and Darkneſs are the Product of their oppoſite Eſſences.</p>
            <p n="105">§. 105. Now that <hi>the Watry Eſſence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Darkneſs in it ſelf,</hi> the Moon will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, which being a Watry Eſſence, Rules or bears Dominion by Night, over the Darkneſs, and therefore muſt partake of Darkneſs: For where there is a Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, there muſt alſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Furthermore it is evident from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Watry Eſſence doth partake of the Darkneſs; for <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1, 2. It is ſaid, that <hi>in the beginning God Created the Heaven and Earth:</hi> Where <hi>Moſes</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates to us, through or by whom Created the World, <hi>viz. in</hi> or through <hi>the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>

               </gap> is the ſame with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Word, <hi>viz.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, the Creator of Heaven and Earth, and <hi>John</hi> in the ſame place expreſly tells us. And that <hi>Moſes, Gen.</hi> 1.1. intimates to us, by whom God Created the Word, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from hence, becauſe when God Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48714:98"/>the World, there was not yet any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of time. Beſides, what Wiſdom can there otherwiſe be found in theſe Words, when it is ſaid that <hi>in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God Created Heaven and Earth,</hi> if by the Beginning be meant only the beginning of time, which can ſignifie no more than this, that when God Created the World, he did Create it. For all Men know, that every thing muſt have a Beginning of Being that thing which it is, when it is firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; this is ſelf evident, neither can it be ſaid of any thing, after that it is Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it ſhall yet be Created. So that there would be not only no Wiſdom in theſe Words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but not ſo much as any paſſable Sence, ſhould we take them in the meaning, according to which moſt men now a days do apprehend them.</p>
            <p>But what is more, the Words will not ſo much as contain a Truth, if by <hi>[in the Beginning]</hi> we underſtand the Beginning of time; for time is nothing elſe but a Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, we conceive in our thoughts, either according to the Courſe of the Sun, or the motion of any other thing from one place to another. Now where there is a Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or Meaſuring, there muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be ſome Created thing, by or according to which the ſaid Meaſuring is performed: ſo that it is evident there could be no time, till after the Creation of the world, And not
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48714:98"/>before it. When therefore it is ſaid that <hi>God Created the Heaven and the Earth in the Beginning, viz.</hi> of time; then time muſt have been before the World was; becauſe when God Created (if we may expreſs our ſelves ſo) there was yet no Beginning of the World; but after that God had Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the World, then firſt it was that the World began to Exiſt, and conſequently Time alſo; for as much as Time is nothing elſe but a Limitation taken from Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and therefore a thing that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequential, and poſterior to the things that are Created, as hath been juſt now ſhewed. So that it would be altogether repugnant to the Nature of the Creation, if by the <hi>[Beginning]</hi> ſhould ſhould be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the beginning of time. Moreover, that by theſe Words <hi>in the Beginning</hi> is to be underſtood Jeſus Chriſt; is a thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by many Authors, and particularly by <hi>Leigh</hi> in his <hi>Critica Sacra</hi> under the Word<gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>After that <hi>Moſes</hi> therefore, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. had ſhewed by whom the World was Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, he next tells us, V. 2d. how or in what condition the Earth was when God had Created it, <hi>viz. Empty and void,</hi> whereby is intimated, that all the Eſſences that were to come forth from the Earth, and belonged to the ſame, lay hid and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48714:99"/>concealed in the Earthly Eſſence, but were not yet fit to Operate, or bring forth Fruit, as appears from hence; becauſe V. 8. on the Third day, the Waters were firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from the Earth, and then it was that the Earth brought forth her Fruit. V. 11. And the reaſon why the Earth was <hi>Empty and Void,</hi> and could not yet bring forth Fruit, was becauſe <hi>Darkneſs was upon the the face of the Deep:</hi> That is, the Fire or Light was yet hid in the Water or Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and therefore the Light could not as yet be Operative, and bring forth Fruits. And after that <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſhewed, how all beings were hid in the Creation, and that in ſuch a manner as that they could not yet orderly exert their Efficiency, which they began firſt to do in the days following; he proceeds next to tell us, from what, and in what manner the Creation was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or carried on, and that in theſe words, <hi>and the Spirit of God moved upon the Waters:</hi> Whence it is evident, that all Beings were produced out of the Water, according to §. 98. and that by the Spirit. Now the firſt thing that was brought forth from the Waters was the Light, which was hid in Darkneſs, or in the Watry Eſſence. For V. 4. it is ſaid, that <hi>God ſeparated the Light from the Darkneſs:</hi> So that the Light was already, <hi>viz.</hi> before its Manifeſtation, but
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48714:99"/>hid in the Darkneſs: For as much as all things were brought forth from out of the Water, by the Spirit, and the Light is ſaid to come out of the Darkneſs; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may infer from hence, that the Darkneſs and the Water are to be taken for one and the ſame Eſſence; as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeems plainly enough to intimate with theſe words; <hi>and the Darkneſs he called Night,</hi> V. 5. For experience teacheth us, that Night or Darkneſs is the cauſe of Cold and Water. Wherefore we are to learn hence, that Darkneſs Communicates with the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Eſſence. And when it is ſaid V. 16. <hi>And the leſſer Light</hi> (the Moon) <hi>to rule the Night,</hi> this informs us that the Moon is of the Nature of the Night or Darkneſs; and this in true, for experience teacheth us, that the Moon Rules over the Water and gives forth moiſture, as the Night or Darkneſs alſo doth. All wich Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations put together, do in my judgement make it very evident, that the Darkneſs is one and the ſame with the Watery Eſſence.</p>
            <p>And for a further proof that the Watry Eſſence is the Darkneſs, we will here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare ſome Expreſſions of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture together, and ſee what underſtanding the ſame will afford us, with relation to this Matter. Man, as long as he lives and cleaves to ſin, is ſaid to be in Darkneſs,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48714:100"/>
               <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.19. &amp;c. and this Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the Eſſence of Bodies, as we are taught, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.12. <hi>Let us caſt off the works of Darkneſs.</hi> Which Works of Darkneſs the Apoſtle enumerates, V. 13. <hi>viz. Riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Drunkenneſs, Chambering, and Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Strife and Envying.</hi> In order to the prevention of theſe, he adviſeth us, V. 14. not to <hi>make proviſion for the Fleſh,</hi> for the gratifying of its <hi>Luſts.</hi> Whence it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to underſtand and that Fleſh and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs have Communion together. This is that which the Apoſtle ſhews at large, <hi>Eph.</hi> 14. and 5. Chapter, where he declares that the unfruitful Works of Darkneſs are the old Man, that is, the unſubdued ſtate of the fleſh. And therefore, as the Darkneſs is not good; ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. tells us of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> that <hi>no good dwells in it,</hi> with many other places to the ſame purpoſe. From all which it is evident, that that which is Fleſhly and Corporeal, is one with the Darkneſs, becauſe that which is bodily contains the Darkneſs in it ſelf. Now it hath been ſhewed §. 27. and 97. That that which is bodily conſiſts of the Watry Eſſence, or hath its Original from it: And ſeing that the Bodily part is called Darkneſs, and that it conſiſts of Water, it follows that the Darkneſs and Watry Eſſence muſt needs partake with each other, and be one.</p>
            <pb n="185" facs="tcp:48714:100"/>
            <p n="106">§. 106. And like as the Fiery Eſſence is a Spirit, ſo alſo is the Water a Spiritual Being, according to §. 102. and therefore the Watry Eſſence hath its Efficiency or Activity as well as Fiery, as hath been ſhewed §. 104. And that all Fiery Spirits or Lives, have not all of them one and the ſame Efficiency is evident from what we read of the good Angels, which in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.7. are called <hi>Flames of Fire:</hi> Some of them alſo are called <hi>Cherubims,</hi> others <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims,</hi> that is Fiery Spirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtle alſo <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. makes a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſtinction between them, calling them <hi>Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, Powers,</hi> And <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.20.21. <hi>And ſet him</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>at his own right hand in the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly places, far above all Principality, Power, Might, and Dominion, and every name that is named.</hi> If any one ſhould ſay that there are only different Denominations given to Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and that notwithſtanding they may all of them be of one and the ſame Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, I would demand of ſuch a one, of what uſe then it is to give them theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Denominations: for if the Apoſtle deſigned only to expreſs one and the ſame thing, by all theſe Names, then it is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a vain Repetition of ſo many words. Beſides it is well known that Names are given to diſtinguiſh things
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48714:101"/>from one another, and to expreſs the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, Uſe, and Operation of the Subject to which ſuch a Name is given. When therefore the Holy Scripture makes a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt Spirits, and Spirits, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them divers Names, ought not we to conclude that theſe different Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſignifie the various Properties and Operations of Spirits, as well as the Names of viſible, and Tangible Subſtances, do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their Properties and Operations. To what purpoſe therefore is it to make this Childiſh evaſion here concerning Spirits, in a matter which is a Received Truth in all other natural things, <hi>viz.</hi> That names are given to things to diſtinguiſh them in their Operations from one another. But theſe are the Fruits of our Modern Carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, we will know of nothing but what is bodily, becauſe we are altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of what is Spiritual. But that the Angels have their different Operations is evident from the <hi>Revelations,</hi> where we find a deſcription of ſeveral Angels, and their different Operations.</p>
            <p>Neither do the Angels only differ thus, but continual Experience alſo teacheth us, that the Lives or fiery Spirits of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do differ from one another in their Operations; for all Lives do not bring forth the ſame kind of Bodies, but as the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48714:101"/>Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>All Fleſh is not the ſame Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. and why ſo, but becauſe the Lives which form the Fleſh and Body (as may be ſeen in the <hi>Obſervations concerning Man</hi> § 37.38.39) have not all of them the ſame Efficiency.</p>
            <p n="107">§. 107. And as all Fiery Spirits or Lives have not the ſame Efficiency, ſo neither are the watry, dark, or refrigerating Eſſences of one operation, as hath been ſhewed in the ſaid <hi>Obſervation,</hi> §. 28 and 33.</p>
            <p>The Holy Scripture alſo Informs us, that the Watry Eſſence conſiſts of many different Spirits, for ſince according to §. 105. the Watry Eſſence, and the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are one, and the Scripture aſſerts the Darkneſs to be an Eſſence, and not a mere nothing, ſeing that it hath its own proper Operations, as appears <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.12. <hi>Let us caſt off the Works of Darkneſs;</hi> and <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful Works of Darkneſs.</hi> Which proves that Darkneſs is a Being, becauſe it hath its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culilar Operations, and what theſe works of Darkneſs are, hath been ſhewed §. 105. Neither hath the Darkneſs only an Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of its own but conſiſts alſo of many Spirits, which have their Government, and Governours, as will be evident by comparing the following Places; <hi>Luke</hi> 22.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48714:102"/>53. our Saviour ſaith, <hi>This is the Power of Darkneſs, viz.</hi> That whereby the Seed of the Serpent ſhould bruiſe his heel. And this Power of Darkneſs our Savoiour calls, <hi>John</hi> 12.31. and 14.30. <hi>the Prince of this World:</hi> which Prince <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. is called <hi>the Prince of the Power of the Aire, the Prince of the Spirit that now worketh in the Children of Diſobedience.</hi> And V. 3. tells us, that the operations of this Spirit are <hi>the Luſts of the Fleſh.</hi> Whence it appears that this Spirit hath Communion with the Spirit of Darkneſs. Moreover, the Apoſtle Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the Fleſh, <hi>viz.</hi> To the Spirit of Darkneſs which Rules the Fleſh, a Will, and Thoughts: And therefore when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. <hi>We wreſtle not against Fleſh and Blood,</hi> he thereby intimates to us, that it is not our outward Fleſh and Blood that puts this force upon us, but the Spirit that Rules this Fleſh, and therefore he immediatly Subjoins, <hi>But againſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities, againſt Powers, against the Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World, againſt Spiritual wickedneſs in high Places.</hi> And theſe Spirits of Darkneſs the Apoſtle calls <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>Darkneſs and the Power of Satan,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="108">§. 108. From all which we conclude, that ſeing that all Bodily things are the Product of the Watry Eſſence, §. 97. and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48714:102"/>that the Watry or Dark Eſſence hath its Spirits §. 107. and the Watry is oppoſite to the Fiery Eſſence, §. 104. and that Man conſiſts of the theſe two Eſſences §. 90.96. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that conſequently he muſt have in him Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Darkneſs, as well as Spirits of Light: which deſerves well to be noted by us, for as much as hereafter it will make way for our underſtanding the Stile, or manner of Expreſſion uſed in Holy Scripture.</p>
            <p n="109">§. 109. But it may be Queried here, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Man conſiſts of theſe two Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Eſſences, and that they are oppoſite to each other, how then can there be any Union between them, ſo as to Co-operate towards, and bring forth one Birth? This Difficulty will be eaſily removed, if firſt we conſider <hi>what <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity is:</hi> Know we therefore, that two Bodies, tho' they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in their Nature, may notwithſtanding be united together, and Co-operate in U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>viz.</hi> when the one of them is made ſubject to the other, and in all reſpects complies with its Operations, ſo as that the one be Paſſive, and the other Active. And if ſuch a Unity as we have now deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed were not between the Fiery and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Eſſence, nothing in the World could be able to ſubſiſt or operate any thing. And therefore our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Math</hi> 6.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48714:103"/>24. <hi>No man can ſerve two Maſters, for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will hate the one and love the other, or elſe he will hold to the one and deſpiſe the other; ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon:</hi> That is, the one or the other of them muſt have Dominion, but cannot both bear ſway at once. And to the ſame purpoſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. that unbelief can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have the Dominion in Conjunction with Faith, <hi>what Communion hath Light with Darkneſs?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay it is not poſſible, that both theſe ſhould bear ſway together, for being contrary to each other, the one muſt bear Rule over the other, before that they can be united.</p>
            <p>Now that there is a Union between theſe two in Nature, we find by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe as long as the fiery Life of each Creature doth perform its ordinary working, the Creature cannot in any of the Members of its Body ſuffer any putrefaction or Mortification: but as ſoon as the Life of a Creature is either over-ruled by another, or ceaſeth from its wonted Operation, then the Watry Eſſence gets the Dominion, and cauſeth Death and Corruption in the ſaid Bodies turning them to Worms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſome Perhaps will object that I have ſaid §. 90. That no two things of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Original can be united; and how then theſe two, <hi>viz.</hi> Light and Darkneſs can be
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48714:103"/>united, ſeing they are contrary to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother? To which I anſwer, firſt, that it is a Fundamental Truth, that two things of a different Original cannot be united; but this is not the caſe here, for we do not ſay that Light and Darkneſs have a different Original, but only that they have a contrary working: Yea quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily we do aſſert, that <hi>tho' Light and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be contrary to each other in operation, yet that they are of one Original, and therefore can be united together.</hi> Now that the Light and Darkneſs, or the Fiery and Watry Eſſence have one Original, we may know by this, becauſe the Light comes out of the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and becauſe Darkneſs may be made Light, and Light Darkneſs. This we are taught <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2 where there was nothing but Darkneſs, and V. 3. The Light was firſt brought forth, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for V. 4. God <hi>Separates the Light from the Darkneſs;</hi> To which the Apoſtle Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, ſaith 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>God who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs.</hi> Foraſmuch therefore, as the Light pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Darkneſs, and can lye hid in the ſame, conſequently they muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with one another, and be ally'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or derived from one Original: For otherwiſe the Light could never be turn'd to Darkneſs, as <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.23. <hi>If then the Light
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48714:104"/>that is in thee be Darkneſe.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 11.35. Take heed therefore, that the Light which is in thee be not Darkneſs. And on the contrary, neither would the Darkneſſ ever become Light, which yet is poſitively aſſerted <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. <hi>For ye were ſometimes Darkneſs but now are ye Light:</hi> Neither would a Darkned Underſtanding ever be capable of being enlightned, which yet is aſſerted <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.18.</p>
            <p>Both theſe Objections are alſo anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in my <hi>Obſervations concerning Man</hi> § 31.32. And therefore I ſhall no further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large upon them here.</p>
            <p n="110">§. 110. We ſhall only by the way take notice here, that if any one from the Exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of thefe two contrary Principles, whereof all Creatures ſubſiſt, ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there muſt be two Gods, one Good and the other Evil, it will be a ſign that he hath not conſidered that the Light may be made Darkneſs, and the Darkneſs Light, as is ſhewed in §. 109. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that theſe two Principles do not ſuppoſe two Gods, but one only, becauſe they are ally'd together, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceed both of them from one God. For if theſe Principles were not brought forth by one God, but the Effects of two ſeveral Deities, then it would be true, that
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48714:104"/>theſe Principles proceeding from two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Cauſes, could not have any Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or be united with one another: But ſeing theſe Principles are United, this ſhews that they proceed from one God.</p>
            <p n="111">§. 111. Hitherto we have ſhewed that all Creatures conſiſt of theſe two Spiritual Eſſences, and that theſe two different Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings conſiſt of many Spirits: But becauſe our Aime is to ſhew, how, or in what ſtate Man was Created by God, we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what kind of Body it was that God Created for <hi>Adam.</hi>

               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:48714:105"/>Body was formed out of Red Earth? For my part I know not what they can make of this. But we ſhall find a fund of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in this word, if we Tranſlate it <hi>the Blood of the Earth.</hi> For <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> Blood, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Life, or the Spiritual part of the Body, as is evident from thoſe places of Scripture that expreſly tell us that Blood ſignifies the Life, or Soul, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.4. <hi>But Fleſh with its Soul</hi> (that is) <hi>its Blood, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.23. <hi>Be ſure that thou eat not the Blood, for the Blood is the Soul.</hi> Whence we are taught, that <hi>Adams</hi> Body being formed of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> it did conſiſt of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Souliſh part of the Earth, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath been ſhewed, that the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal is brought forth from that which is Spiritual.</p>
            <p n="113">§. 113. But it is not ſufficient for us to know of what the Humane Body was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; but we muſt further enquire why God gave Man a Body.</p>
            <p n="114">§. 114. In order therefore to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing why God hath given <hi>Adam</hi> a Body, we muſt firſt of all enquire <hi>why Man was Created by God?</hi> To which commonly is anſwered, that Man was Created to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, and to publiſh his Virtues and Praiſe, with other ſuch like, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48714:105"/>do contain a Truth, if we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what is required to the Glorifying of God. But that we may not from theſe Expreſſions conceive any Humane thoughts of God, as if he were delighted, as Men are with hearing himſelf praiſed: Let us enquire into the Bottom of what theſe words import; and that by putting this Query, whether a man when he Glorifies God, be not operative? To which the anſwer muſt be affirmative, becauſe the leaſt Action or Thought is an Operation: If therefore the Glorifying of God be a working; the next thing we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire is, wherein this Working conſiſts: This Operation of Glorifying God, and Magnifying of his name, doth not conſiſt in this, that God thereby receives more Prefection, or a greater degree of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, and that from his Creature, for as much as God is every way perfect, yea that Being from whom and through whom all things are brought forth, and are ſtill daily maintained; ſo that God can have no more perfection or worthineſs now, than he hath ever had: for as much as to that which is perfect in all reſpects, nothing more can be added. What then is this Work or Operation of Man, whereby he Glorifies God, and wherein doth it Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt? Mans Glorifying of God conſiſts in
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48714:106"/>this, that he performs that which God hath Commanded him, which Command is expreſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. <hi>And God ſaid unto them be fruitful and multiply, and repleniſh the Earth, and ſubdue it, and have Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over the Fiſh of the Sea, and over the Fowl of the Heaven, and over every living thing that creepeth upon the Earth.</hi> So that we ſee God commands Man to <hi>be fruitful,</hi> and this Fruitfulneſs conſiſts in <hi>Multiplying,</hi> which Expreſſions are Repeated V. 22. Man was alſo commanded to Repleniſh or <hi>fill the Earth,</hi> that is he ſhould exalt the Earth to that perfection, to which it was to be brought, and advanced, <hi>viz.</hi> to be made Spiritual and Glorious. And that this is the ſence of theſe words, appears from hence, that man hath an Earthly Body, which is maintained from the Earth, for Man continually Eats and is nouriſhed with that which is Earthly, which Earthly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Food hath been given him to the end he might make it Heavenly and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, as is abundantly ſhewed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. and V. 54. it is ſaid, that the Sinners Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Body ſhall be made Immortal, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea the whole Duty of Man towards his God Conſiſts in this, that he make the Earthly, or Dark and Watry Eſſence (whereof his Body Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally conſiſts, according to §. 98.) Light
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48714:106"/>and Glorious, and by this means approach near to the Divine, and unchangeable Light, and attain to Communion with the ſame. And to the end he might thus fill the Earth, that is, make it Spiritual, God alſo Commanded <hi>Adam to ſubdue the Earth:</hi> whereby is not meant that man ſhould have the Earth under his Feet, go upon it, or Till and Cultivate it, for this Nature ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently teacheth us, neither was there any need of a Command to inforce it: but hereby is intimated to us, that it is the great duty of Man to have the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Dark Eſſence whereof his Body doth Conſiſt, under his power and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; ſo as that the ſaid Dark Eſſence might not bear Rule over the Fiery, but on the contrary, that his Glorious and Illuminated Spirit, ſhould Rule over the Dark or Watry Eſſence whereof his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doth conſiſt, and over the Spirits that are in it, (of which ſee §. 107.) and the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>ſignifies to <hi>have Dominion over, to Conquer, to bring into Subjection and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> And when we put ſuch a Sence as this upon theſe Words, <hi>Repleniſh the Earth and Subdue it,</hi> we ſhall find them to hold forth Wiſdom and Underſtanding, and ſuch as doth excellently agree and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with the Nature of Man, ſeing that he conſiſts of theſe two different Eſſences,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48714:107"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> The Fiery and the Watry. Neither is there any thing, throughout the whole Current of Scripture, more preſt upon, than to mortify his Fleſh, to Subdue it, and Glorifie it through the Spirit, as hath been ſhewed §. 39.40, 105, 107. So that the ſame thing which was Commanded to <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 1.28. the Sinner muſt now obtain through much ſuffering, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Deaths.</p>
            <p n="115">§. 115. Seing therefore, that it is the great duty, and Work of Man, purſuant to Gods Command, to Subdue that which is Earthly and Bodily, and to make it Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, it was of abſolute neceſſity that he ſhould be partaker of the Earthly, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his Glorifying of it. And for this Reaſon Man had an Earthly Body beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him, to the end he ſhould make that Body which is fed and maintained from the Earth Spiritual and illuminate its Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Moreover, God gave to Man <hi>Dominion over the Fiſhes of the Sea, and over the Fowl of Heaven, and over every living thing that creepeth upon the Earth.</hi> And this was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary becauſe man was appointed to fill or repleniſh the Earth, and to Subdue it. In the word Earth being alſo comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded whatſoever conſiſts of the Earth or
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48714:107"/>Water, becauſe the Earth hath its Original from the Water; to the end therefore that Man might have Dominion over all theſe Creatures, it was neceſſary for him to have ſome Communion with them, that is to be partaker of their Natures, to the end that Ruling over them, he might in, and through the Glorification of his own Body Glorify them alſo, and make them Spiritual. And this could have been done in and through <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe he being the Head of the Earth, did Govern all things by his Spirit, and therefore was partaker of all Living Crèatures, that ſo they might not be exempted from his Dominion. And that <hi>Adam</hi> was thus Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of all Living things appears from this, that Man to this day doth Partake of the Fiſh, Fowl, and Beaſts, becauſe he enjoys the ſame for his Food and Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. Moreover, which is well to be minded, he was alſo to <hi>have Dominion over every Creeping thing, viz.</hi> Worms and other Infects, which Worms were not without him, for the Body conſiſts of Worms, as appears, becauſe when it dies it turns to Worms, and Worms are the firſt Life of all Creatures, becauſe all things that die turn to Worms.</p>
            <p n="116">§. 116. And to the end we may more
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48714:108"/>clearly Diſſect the Condition and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Adam,</hi> we are well to conſider, that <hi>Adam</hi> before the Fall, did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, nor exiſt as we Sinners now do; for we are part and Members of <hi>Adam,</hi> which were in <hi>Adam,</hi> (as is hinted §. 78.) we therefore being the Members of <hi>Adam,</hi> cannot have the ſame Perfection which <hi>Adam</hi> had, who was the whole, that is, who had all Men in himſelf: And in this reſpect the Apoſtle ſaith very well 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. That <hi>we all are one Body,</hi> yet ſo as that we are Members of that Body, now the Members have not one and the ſame, or an alike powerful Operaton, neither are all of the ſame worth and dignity; nor hath every Member ſeparately the ſame worthineſs with the whole Body. Whence we underſtand that none of <hi>Adams</hi> Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can have the Excellency which <hi>Adam</hi> hath, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> is the Head and Body, whereof all Men are only the Members, and every Member Separately hath only the Perfection of being ſuch a Member, and not of being the whole Body.</p>
            <p>Neither is <hi>Adam</hi> only to be conſidered as the Head of all Mankind, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, far more excellent than any of his Poſterity, but ſuch alſo was the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of <hi>Adam,</hi> that the had the whole Earth and all Creatures in himſelf, that is,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48714:108"/>that he Ruled over them all, and this could not be, except that his Spirit had dwelt in all things, and Govern'd them. And that all Creatures were in <hi>Adam,</hi> that is, that the whole Earth, and all living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were upheld and Govern'd by his Spirit, in the ſame manner as the Central Spirit of Man, upholds and Governs his whole Body; we learn from hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, the whole Earth was curſed for his ſake, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17. Now if ſo be the whole Earth and all that is in it, had not been a part of <hi>Adam,</hi> what conſequence, or connexion could there be in this, that upon <hi>Adams</hi> ſinning the whole Earth ſhould be declared ſinful? Moreover we Read <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19, 20, 21, 22. That <hi>the Creature, as with a ſtretched forth head wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth for the Manifeſtation of the Sons of God: For the Creature was made ſubject to Vanity, not willingly, but by or through him who hath ſubjected the ſame, in hope that the Creature it ſelf alſo ſhall be delivered from the Bondage of Corruption, into the Glorious Libery of the Sons of God. For we know that the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion groaneth and is in travel together until now.</hi> When the Apoſtle here ſaith, that the whole Creation, that is, the whole Earth is made ſubject to Vanity or Corruption, by him who hath ſubject it, <hi>viz.</hi> to Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, can this poſſibly be underſtood of any
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48714:109"/>one but of <hi>Adam?</hi> No ſurely, for God had Commanded <hi>Adam</hi> that the ſhould Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the Earth, or ſubject it, but not to Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but by Glorifying the ſame, as hath been ſaid §. 114. tho he did the contrary. If therefore <hi>Adam,</hi> being the Head and Governour of the whole Earth, hath made the whole Creation, <hi>viz.</hi> the Earth ſubject to Vanity, is not then this our Aſſertion true and ſtedfaſt, that the whole Earth and all that is in it, is a part of <hi>Adam.</hi> Yea the Apoſtle ſaith as much in plain words, by calling Men, the Earth, and whatſoever is in the ſame <hi>one whole Creation,</hi> or Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; thereby expreſly ſhewing, that the whole Earth is not any thing ſeparate from <hi>Adam,</hi> but belongs to him, and makes up one Creature with him.</p>
            <p n="117">§. 117. But altho' God, according to §. 115. Created Man to Repleniſh the Earth, and to ſubdue it, yet withal God ſo Created man, that he could do the ſame of his Free Will without compulſion, as was ſhewed §. 33.34. and ſad experience ſufficiently convinceth, that <hi>Adam</hi> could tranſgreſs this Command of God. But of this we ſhall Treat hereafter, when we come to ſpeak of Mans Fall, and by what and how it happened.</p>

            <head>AN APPENDIX OF <hi>Several Queſtions with their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers Concerning the Hypotheſis of the</hi> Revolution of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Souls.</head>
            <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>THe Hypotheſis being this,</hi> viz. <hi>That every individual of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind muſt ſeveral times die and be Born again, in Order to the working out of their Salvation here in this Word: It is Queried firſt, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Books of this Author treating of ſuch a</hi> Revolution of Humane Souls <hi>have been Printed and Publiſhed in divers Languages, and in different Countries?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1. Yes, Diverſe Books of this Authors Treating of ſuch a Revolution of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:48714:111"/>Humane Souls have been Printed in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Languages, and that in ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>What do ſome of the Learned judge concerning this Hypotheſis?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. They are ſomewhat reſerved and ſhy, openly to declare their Thoughts concerning this Matter; becauſe it ſeems as yet to be very novel, and but little known to the moſt: But when reminded they may then remember, that both the Books which Treat thereof, as alſo many clear Texts of Holy Scripture, evincing the ſame, are not unknown to them: and then they muſt own, that it is impoſſible to underſtand many places of the Holy Scripture without this Hypotheſis.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>What does the unlearned ſay of it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some of the Unlearned, having little or no judgement of their own, and being prepoſſeſſed with a prejudice from others, do ſuppoſe it to be a vain Opinion, which the <hi>Jews</hi> received from the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. 4. <hi>What is the reaſon that not any of the Learned have indeavoured to confute (as yet) theſe Books, nor manifeſtly to prove that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48714:111"/>there can be no ſuch Revolution of Humane Souls?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe when ſome write great Books it may, for the moſt part, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that they endeavour rather to drown a Doctrine, then to find out a Truth: So that it's not to be wondred at, that the Learned hitherto (for any thing I know) have not written againſt it, nor demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated (in ſhort) that the return of Souls is impoſſible: in as much as it is impoſſible for them to perform this, as it is for them to demonſtrate that the propagation of Mankind depends not on any precedent Generation, it having continued immortal from <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. 5. <hi>What is the reaſon why this Doctrine hath, for theſe many Ages, been as it were, loſt amongſt men in</hi> Europe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Reaſon why this Doctrine hath been ſo much hid is, becauſe Men are become for the moſt part Corporeal and Carnal, ſo that they cannot ſee nor appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend any thing, but what is ſuitable to, and (as we may ſay) taſtes of this preſent Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Fleſh and Blood, though that alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually is changing, and remains not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly the ſame.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 6. <hi>Whence did the wiſe</hi> Heathens
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48714:112"/>
               <hi>derive their knowledge in ſome part of this Doctrine?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The wiſe <hi>Heathens</hi> as <hi>Socrates,</hi> &amp;c. have by continual Searching, been able to find out this Truth in part; foraſmuch as the Myſteries of Holy Scripture were not made known to them, they could not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the full Diſcovery thereof, but as it is manifeſt in Nature: But the wiſe <hi>Jews</hi> have drawn it fully from that Sacred Fountain.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 7. <hi>How comes it to paſs that the</hi> Jews <hi>of old, better underſtood this Doctrine (as appears by their Writings concerning the ſame) then modern</hi> Jews, <hi>and the wiſe</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> being at that time Gods peculiar choſen People, were conſequently to abound more with Love then the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> did; wherefore alſo a clearer know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this Doctrine was imparted to them, which the Modern <hi>Jews</hi> have much loſt: In as much as the knowledge of this Truth, and true Love go hand in hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and are inſeparable.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 8. <hi>What then is true Love</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Love is a perfect Emanation, or beaming forth of the Life, and is Spiritual, without which no perfect work can be
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48714:112"/>wrought or brought forth either in Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals or Supernaturals.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 9. <hi>What is the chiefeſt, moſt perfect, and wiſe Efficiency, energy, or out-working of the true Love? and how may we have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the ſame, in our ſelves, and in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The true Spiritual, loving ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Life every one, eſpecially the Married Perſon, may rightly and fully have the experience of in himſelf, if ſo be he Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates his Child in true Love, and this is the beginning of the firſt Efficiency of love. The ſecond is that wherewith the Child when it is Born is continually regarded and beheld, and wiſely lookt after and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, the Parent ſtill preſerving and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the ſame love for his Child in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without prodigally laviſhing out the ſame. So that they who thus give out prudently their Love, they will find by experience, that when their Children come to Diſcretion, and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that this inward, reſerved, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and prudent Working-love, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in the Parents, and deſcend to the Children, and from them reflect back in true Obedience to the Parent. Moreover this reflection of the Childrens love to the Parents, cannot but produce a freſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of love in the Parents which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48714:113"/>the Life of Children, according to <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee, that thy Life may be long in the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</hi> Whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the true Efficiency of Love, muſt be an Emanation of Life, becauſe it can prolong the Lives of Children.</p>
            <p>The ſame may alſo be experienced in a contrary Efficiency of the Life, <hi>viz.</hi> In a hatred mixt with fear, or in a Faith mixt with doubt, as may eaſily and plainly be found in ſuch as are young Perſons, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with old Wives or Husbands, and are deſirous of their Deaths. For at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame time, that they earneſtly deſire to be rid of them, they continually have ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lurking in their minds and inceſſant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief or perſwaſion (which is an efficient power of the Life) that they will not dye: whereby the hated is prolonged to a very old Age. For at the very ſame time, that the young one earneſtly deſireth the death of the old one, the life of the young one works a Faith, or Belief, which preſerves the old one alive: So that it is by their doubting, that their own proper love, life and faith, do all co-operate together. Theſe and ſuch like emanations of love and hatred, many have experienced, and have been ſenſible of, but never could conceive
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48714:113"/>what ſhould be the Reaſon thereof; which indeed was this, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe from their youth they have been filled with other Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Corporeal, and contrary deſires and notions.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 10. <hi>Can it be made out plainly, and in the conſequent Effect thereof, even to the outward Senſes, that the life of Man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy another life or body, either wholly or in part; and immediatly form another new one, in all its parts which hath no ſimilitude with the former?</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes this cannot be denied, becauſe experience and Obſervation hath, and doth evince it by manifold Inſtances, whereof we will here inſert one Narration relating to the change of an intire part of anothers Body. The Example is this: A certain Woman being with Child, and neär her time, in ſearching for ſomething amongſt old Raggs, happened unexpectedly to touch with her Thumb, the dried foot of a Hare, which unknown to her lay amongſt thoſe Raggs; which ſo affrightned her, that ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly (or ſoon after) fell into labour, and was delivered of a Child, whoſe Thumb of its right Hand was changed into a Hares Foot perfect in all its parts, as having all about it haire, and divided into Claws with ſharp Nails at the end of them, &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="212" facs="tcp:48714:114"/>
            <p>Queſt. 11. <hi>How can it be proved, and made out, that perſons deceaſed, dead and gone, do come to be born again, and to appear in this world, ſo as to be plainly diſcerned by their outward ſhape, and features?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is, and may be very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently perceived in ſome places, as great Cities of Trade, where Perſons of ſeveral Nations, (happen to be joyned together in Marriage, as for example, in <hi>Flanders,</hi> whither are tranſported old ſwarthy <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> Merchants, who Marry with Young clear, white <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Women: And then it is frequently obſerved, that theſe ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Men get many fair and clear Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by their Wives (for by the way ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the reaſon why they get rather Daughters then Sons, is becauſe old Men do commonly bear greater love to young Women, then young Women do to old Men) Now when theſe white <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Daughters are grown up, and Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to white <hi>Flemiſh</hi> men, and are gotten with Child by them, then will the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Citizens know by experience, and cry that the old <hi>Portugeeſe</hi> Grand-father will then appear or be born again in that Child: and accordingly, it generally happens that that Child in all its parts reſembleth the ſwarthy <hi>Portugees</hi> its Grand-father. This is alſo often ſeen in a wiſe Father, who
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48714:114"/>begets a fooliſh Son, and that Fooliſh Son begets a wiſe Son afterwards, ſo as the wiſdom of he Grand-father comes to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Grand-ſon: the ſame may be obſerved as to all other parts both of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and mind, betwixt ſuch Relations. Moreover, the like is alſo ſometime ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced by very old perſons, that have lived to ſee four Generations deſcended from them; how that the Grand and great Grand-fathers have appeared in their Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, even to the third and fourth Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. So that from hence, we may in part underſtand what is ſaid in <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.8, 9, 10. Where God ſtrengthens his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment with this Reaſon: <hi>For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, viſiting the ſins of the Parents unto the third and fourth Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 12. <hi>Whether the firſt Sin comitted<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted by</hi> Adam <hi>and</hi> Eve, <hi>whereby they ſubjected themſelves to the fleſhly body, be Infinite?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, Their Sin could not be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, becauſe their underſtanding was but finite.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 13. <hi>Is there then any number or Meaſure to be aſſigned, whereby the Fall of</hi> Adam <hi>and</hi> Eve <hi>(wherein they became Bodily and Carnal) can be cleared and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes there is, and the ſame is the Number, <hi>Four:</hi> for each of them conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of two Beigns, <hi>viz.</hi> Male and Female, as all and every one fo Mankind doth: every Man hath the Male nature as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant in him, and beſides that he hath the Female Nature alſo: So is it likewiſe with the Woman who hath the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Nature predominant in her, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Male Nature in her too. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Lord ſaith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27. That he had Created <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> Male and Female, <hi>viz.</hi> In each perſon, ſo that alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether make up the Number <hi>Four.</hi> And therefore their Children and all their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity were to conſiſt of Four Eſſences, as being their Off-Spring: And therefore, for this Reaſon they could not ſin beyond that Number: whence it is ſaid <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.5. alſo <hi>Ch.</hi> 34.7. <hi>Viſiting the Iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children, and upon the Childrens Children, unto the third, and to the fourth Generation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 14. <hi>How long a terme of time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was neceſſary for</hi> Adam <hi>and</hi> Eve <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of, and to ſuffer for their Sins, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to a reſtitution and a recovery?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Both of them together require four Thouſand Years: becauſe (as was ſaid) they conſiſted of four Eſſences; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48714:115"/>the Pſalmiſt ſaith in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.3, 4. &amp;c. <hi>Thou turneſt man to deſtruction, and ſayeſt, return ye Children of men, for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years are but as yeſterday,</hi> &amp;c. Which place of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> is alſo cited by St. <hi>Peter</hi> in 2 <hi>Peter ch.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>One day is with the Lord as a thouſand Years, and a thouſand years as one day,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 15. <hi>From whence may we begin the Computation of the Thouſand Years of the life of theſe four Eſſences?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> From the perfect number <hi>[Ten]</hi> beyound which we cannot Number; alſo all men muſt conſiſt of the Number <hi>[Ten,]</hi> thu conſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> his four Eſſences are (as aboveſaid) two Male, and two Female, and the Subdiviſion of the two Male is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to five out-working Powers, an five like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the Female, which make 10. to which alſo doth correſpond the two Lobes of the Brain, the right as being the Male, working-out Images, or Ideas; and the left receiving them, and then when thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, and born (as it were) are they ſent into the little Brain, which is the Root of all the Nerves of Motion; and thence through the Nerves are conveighed to the Right hand, which may be accounted the Male Hand, which hath five Fingers, and alſo the like to the left or Female Hand, to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48714:116"/>Work out; all which, together make ten, and if we add to the former this other fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſame may be ſaid of the two Feet, whoſe ten Toes added to the Hands ten Fingers make up twenty, which (hereafter) is proved to be the compleat Working out of a Man, he then becoming Ripe to bear Fruits, or to beget, and bring forth Children; ſo as his Feet correſpond to the Rootes, and his Hands to the Branches. And therefore hath no more then ten Fingers wherewith to effect and Work out their ten Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or Powers; as it appears in a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man big with Child, who upon ſome Fright, or put into any other Paſſion, doth there form on that very part of her Childs Body, ſome ſtrange live Impreſſion of ſome external thing, by an effective applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her own hand, upon that very part of her own Body. And foraſmuch as man conſiſteth of ten Powers, or Faculties, therefore alſo ten Commandments have been given to him to obſerve: according to that in <hi>Eccleſ. ch</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 13. Let us hear the Concluſion of the Matter: <hi>Fear God and keep his Commandments, for this is the whole Man.</hi> This very Text of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the <hi>Jews</hi> do make to be the Summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or chief Head of their whole <hi>Talmud.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thus, <hi>viz.</hi> Children muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Womb of their Mothers, for to attain or get, by the influence or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Moon over the Monthly Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, a perfect Body, in the ſpace of ten Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Months, which conſiſts of 40 Weeks. And ſeeing that Man is made of the ten Lunary Operations, That is the reaſon, why, when a Man doth Govern himſelf perverſely, and to his utmoſt power, doth tye himſelf too much to his own Will and Fancy, he becomes Lunatick or Mad, and is then wholly under the Governing Rule of the Moon.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 17. <hi>If the Terme of Mans life was appointed to be a thouſand Years, how then comes it to paſs, that</hi> Adam <hi>lived but</hi> 930. <hi>Years?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The reaſon was becauſe of his Fall or Sin: And it became manifeſted in <hi>Cain,</hi> why <hi>Adam</hi> finiſhed not his thouſand Years, Seventy of them being wanting: which number Seventy conſiſts of ten times ſeven, which was that vengeance that ſhould be taken on any one that ſhould kill <hi>Cain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. 18. <hi>Why had</hi> Adam <hi>by his wife two Sons at one Birth, neither more nor leſs, as</hi> Gen. 4.1, 2. <hi>doth ſhew?</hi>

            <pb n="218" facs="tcp:48714:117"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The reaſon ſeems to be this: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Adam</hi> had been in two different States, Conditions, or Beings, before that he knew <hi>Eve:</hi> The one was antecedent to his Fall; the other was after it. For which reaſon ſhe was to conceive Twins, he knowing of her but once as appears by the Text, whereof in the order of Nature, the eldeſt muſt be born laſt, and the firſt Born laſt conceived: which is confirmed and made plain in that of <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. v. 27, 28, 29, 30. Both in the Words, and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Tamars Midwife,</hi> and the red Threed uſed by her, as it is there mentioned at large.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 19. <hi>Why was</hi> Adam 130 <hi>Years of Age when he knew his Wife a ſecond time, and ſhe brought forth</hi> Seth, <hi>as it is in</hi> Gen. 4.25. <hi>and Ch. 5. v. 3.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> May not this be ſuppoſed to be the Reaſon? Becauſe this was the full time of <hi>Cains</hi> being Seven-fold avenged by <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech,</hi> who had ſlain him, ſo that then he was not longer the keeper of his Brother <hi>Abel:</hi> when <hi>Lamech</hi> with great earneſtneſs declared to his Wives, The Revolution of Humane Souls; ſaying, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 4. v. 23.) <hi>Hear my Voice ye Wives of</hi> Lamech, <hi>for I have ſlain a man to wounding, and a Young man,</hi> by Sodomy, (if the place in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48714:117"/>be truly Interpreted.) Alſo this Number of 7. may be taken in the manner as were the 20 Years in which the Young men were appointed to ſerve in the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> as it is in <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> 24, 27. to the end. Alſo in the manner of thoſe who were to go out to War, as in <hi>Num. Ch.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 18, 20, 22, 24. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which if we allow to add about one Year and a half, after they were married for the bringing forth of Children, we ſhall find that the Number of 6 times 21 Years and a half, will make 129 Years: and then, if we further allow one year more to <hi>Adam,</hi> who was Created a perfect man, and who had therefore no need to ſtay till he was twenty Years of Age, before he begat Children. <hi>Adams</hi> Years will be found to amount to 130. in which <hi>Cain</hi> was 7 times avenged, that is, he paſſed through 7 ſuch Lives, each con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining 21 ½ Years. And as the 130 Years of <hi>Adam,</hi> make up the time of <hi>Cains Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance:</hi> So the Number of <hi>Lamechs</hi> Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, <hi>viz.</hi> 77 times 21 ½ of Years will have for their Product the time from <hi>Adam</hi> to the Flood, <hi>viz.</hi> 1656. with a ſmall allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of half a Year only.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 20. <hi>Muſt not all men, as to their peculiar individualities, receives and keep their whole and perfect Eſſence, and a continual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, for otherwiſe, could thoſe parts be taken away, loſt and Annihilated, there would be remaing not ſo much as one ſingle Man.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 21. <hi>Whether in the firſt Man</hi> Adam, <hi>were all men Created and comprehended in an infinite Number?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, This could not be ſo, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſons which might be given; but let this one ſerve, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe had it been ſo, then the World could never have come to an end in its out-working: and <hi>Adam</hi> would have been an unchangeable Being, which could never have died.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 22. <hi>Whether all thoſe men, whom we find are born with one or more defects, either in Body, Mind, or Both were ſo Created at firſt in</hi> Adam?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, this cannot be admitted: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if it were ſo Men could not be the cauſe of their own defects, but the Creator ſhould have been the cauſe of them; which to ſuppoſe, is altogether abſurd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: Becauſe he is all good, Wiſe, and juſt, and could not be the cauſe of theſe the Defects of men, <hi>viz.</hi> To make them to be Fools, Blind, Deaf, Sickly,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48714:118"/>Lame, Criples, Churliſh, Cruel and ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, to be Monſters, and Abortives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which have a true and right beginning, but are never brought to perfection.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 23. <hi>Whether all men who were Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in</hi> Adam <hi>had not given them to have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and free-will,</hi> viz. <hi>To do that which is good, and to forbear that which is Evil?</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This alſo cannot be denied by any rational man, for many Reaſon need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to be recounted here.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 24. <hi>Whether</hi> Adam <hi>and his poſterity were not to live and abide ſo long till they had, by Generation propagated and produced all thoſe who were Created in him; being as many as were neceſſary to the compleating of this World?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48714:119"/>many hundred Years (as before this accurtation) then their wickedneſs would have increaſed to that degree, that the predeſtinated, or appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time of the Worlds duration could not have allowed room for ſufficient Revolutions or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generations, wherein men might come to ſuffer for their evil deeds; which the Scripture tells us,</hi> (Rom. 6. v. 2.7. and 1 Pet. 1.17. and Rev. 14.13. and <hi>ch.</hi> 20.13.) muſt follow them, and have the ſame meaſure meeted out to them which they have meaſured to others, Mat. 7.2.

            <p>Queſt. 26. <hi>What is the reaſon of the Law expreſſed in</hi> Deut. 23.2. A Baſtard ſhall not enter into the Congregation of the Lord, even to his tenth Generation, <hi>&amp;c. For by a Baſtard here, is properly to be underſtood, a Child born in Adultery, of a married Wife. Now, as in this caſe, the uniting, or Marriage-band of the aforeſaid Number of</hi> [Ten] <hi>is broken, (as appears in a foregoing Queſtion) whether (I ſay) accordingly this Baſtard, (who former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48714:119"/>alſo muſt have been an Adulterer) and whoſe works muſt follow him; and the ſame meaſure muſt be meeted to him again, which he hath mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured to another, as the above cited Scriptures tell us) muſt not die, and be born again ten times in order to his obtaining to the perfect number,</hi> viz. <hi>From one to ten: which he had loſt by his Adultery; and may not this be illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by this following Simile,</hi> viz. <hi>Suppoſe that a good Gardner, having in his Garden many wild Olive Trees, and amongſt the reſt, ſhould be one planted, and ingrafted at ſeveral times, with ten of its own Scions, every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the product of a former Ingrafting, he having ingrafted them, ſtill higher and higher, in hopes that from his tenth perfect or full grown Scion, he ſhould have ſufficient wherewith to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graft all his other wild Olive-Trees, and by this means obtain many good Fruits from them (eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ingrafting being a death (nothing being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered but by looſing its former life, which is a Death) by which they become gradually better, and better,) now ſhould this Gardner take a journey, and at his return, find this Tree either ſtoln or removed or cut down which he had In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted ten times before, and another wild Olive Tree planted in its ſtead; would not this good Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener, in all probability take the ſame courſewith this new, ſtrange and changed wild Olive Tree, by endeavouring to Graft it likewiſe ten ſeveral
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:48714:120"/>times in order to its Melioration, as he did to the former?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Surely Yes.</p>
            <p>I have obſerved and found in one of the greater ſort of Figgs, about 666 ſeveral Seeds. Now if any perſon, would take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to conſideration one of the ſaid Seeds, he would find that naturally it conſiſts of three parts. Alſo he will find, that the firſt is the Body, which is the outward viſible, and mortal part; wherein there lies hidden, two immortal and Spiritual principles or Beings, which former and produced the firſt part, <hi>viz.</hi> the Body, by drawing nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment from the Earth. The Second part is the Watry, Female, Spiritual, and immortal ſubſtance, out of which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the firſt mortal part, <hi>viz.</hi> the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The third part is a Fiery, Powerful, Male, Spiritual, and immortal Being, which is the chief Work-maſter of his Body, and that out of the ſecond Female wateriſh Principle. It is not eaſily to be denyed, that the two Spiritual parts of the above-written Seeds. Should not contain hidden in their inward eſſential and ſpiritual parts, a perfect Figg-Tree, with Figgs and Seeds, to be brought forth in due time, when ſown, then they will manifeſt Trees, Fruits, and Seeds: and ſo in ſew Years would bring forth and multiply an incomprehenſible
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:48714:120"/>number of Trees, which neither this World, nor others beſides would be able to contain them.</p>
            <p>But the All-wiſe Creator, who made this World, hath ſo perfectly Created and ordered it, that there is neither too much nor too little in it: So that none of the ſmalleſt Creatures can vaniſh to nothing, not one excepted; by reaſon that all the parts are neceſſary to make up a whole.</p>
            <p>So that it was neceſſary that the Creator ſhould Create ſo many Seeds, Figgs, and Trees as the Earth ſhould have need to bring forth for this whole World, and no more: it not being (as ſome think) that ſome parts can go to nothing, when they are burned or corrupted. Now becauſe ſome are too corporeally and fleſhly dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened in their minds and underſtandings, they cannot diſcern that the Spiritual part aboveſaid cannot be loſt, nor die: becauſe the Spiritual part is the former, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer of the Bodies. Should any one read this, and alſo ſeriouſly take into his conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration what ſtands in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.22. <hi>And</hi> Adam <hi>called his wifes name</hi> Eve, (<hi>or</hi> Chavah) <hi>becauſe ſhe was the Mother of all living:</hi> He would readily grant that it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that any man could have his Being
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:48714:121"/>and not have it from her, or not to be a partaker of hers.</p>
            <p>Now let it be remarked that all that is aboveſaid, doth by a natural Analogy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe alſo how Man, together with all other Animal Creatures and Beings are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, propagated, and Multiplyed, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf uſing a Similitude of this ſort for this very purpoſe in <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.24.</p>

WHether if <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had not tranſgreſſed and fallen, would there have been need of a Temple, or Worſhip therein; they then worſhipping God, according to that in 4. <hi>John</hi> v. 23.24. <hi>in Spirit and in Truth?</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were not they therefore (as Chriſt ſaid of himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) <hi>greater then the Temple?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Whether if <hi>Adam</hi> had not fallen, would not <hi>Eve</hi> have conceived Spiritually, as the Bleſſed <hi>Virgin</hi> did, <hi>viz.</hi> By the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. Whether, ſeing that a Temple was commanded to be Built, did it not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Whole Man, <hi>viz.</hi> The Holy of Holies, repreſenting the inward Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Man, which is the Temple wherein God appears to Man, for to aſſiſt and help him for his Good?</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Whether if the Temple did repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Man, ought it not therefore to be
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48714:122"/>built according to the Meaſures of Man, whom it did repreſent?</p>
            <p n="5">V. Whether if the Temple was 46 years in building, doth not that number of time, ſignify the number which is proper to the make or eſſential Being of Man, which requires 10 Lunar Months, or fourty Weeks, to abide in the Womb for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his Body, which is made out of the humidity that is governed by the Moon?</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Whether the 6 years may not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond to the 6 days of the Creation.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Whether when our Lord Chriſt was tempted in the Wilderneſs, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.1, 2. and faſted 40 days and nights, did he not in that faſting conſume the fleſh of the Old Man, and Spiritualize it? and after it is ſaid in V. 2. <hi>he hungred,</hi> that is, to bring back Humane Nature into its true ſtate and Reſtoration, in and by himſelf?</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Whether in caſe it be found true, that after 4000 Years from the Creation (according to the computation of the Holy Writ it ſelf, and alſo of natural Reaſon) the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> was then to be wrought out and ended; muſt not conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently this be the fulneſs of time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to come and appear?</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Whether, if <hi>Adam</hi> (as aboveſaid) had not fallen, he would have Spiritually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48714:122"/>muſt it not of neceſſity follow, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> being to come in the place of <hi>Adam,</hi> muſt be likewiſe Spiritually concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of a <hi>Virgin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">X. Whether, if Chriſt, who was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and was therefore to be united to <hi>Adam;</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored and perfected through Death and Sufferings; doth it not hence follow, that Chriſt alſo ought to ſuffer Death, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Glorious Redemption, and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for us?</p>
            <p n="11">XI. Whether as Chriſt was born under the Law, muſt he not be ſubjected to the Law? and accordingly did he not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fulfil the Law, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.18. and <hi>Luke</hi> 16.17.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. Whether therefore was it not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that all the Righteous Duties which the Law commands, ſhould be performed, and compleated by him and moreover, that he ſhould do, teach, and command us, to love our Enemies; to be poor in Spirit, and ſubmit to Death: whereby to obtain Life, and many other ſuch like Virtues?</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. Whether he was not therefore to give them the Power (as in <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.19, 20, 21, 22.) to eſteem and uſe him as a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and to hang him on the Croſs, and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> did the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, (as in <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.14.) Seing that all Created Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48714:123"/>are made out of Worms, or creeping things, of which the Serpent is to be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the chiefeſt. Which Serpent was in <hi>Eve</hi> (as was all Beings in the World, as ſhe was the Mother of all Living, as it is ſaid in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.20.) and deceived her.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. Whether the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> (as being the Seed of the Woman) hath not broken the head of the Serpent; having through death, finiſhed Redemption, as he himſelf teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Croſs, as in <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.30.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. Whether conſidering Chriſt did outwardly, and viſibly appear in the Fleſh was it not neceſſary the outward and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Ear ſhould hear a Voice from Heaven ſignifying the ſame as in <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. from 30 to 35.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. Whether if we rightly conſider what our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.5.6. <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.7, 8. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.1, 2, 3. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.1.2.3.4.5.6. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46. Where the ſends forth and commanded his twelve Diſciples not to go in the way of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> neither into any City of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> but rather to the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and to Preach, ſaying <hi>The Kingdom of God is at hand,</hi> we may not find Cauſe to ſuppoſe that he came to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Kingdom for the <hi>Jews,</hi> he having before ſent his <hi>Diſciples</hi> to prepare them for the Kingdom, eſpecially conſidering <hi>Acts</hi> 1.6. The Diſciples asking if he would then
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48714:123"/>reſtore the Kingdom to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that after they had received the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt they ſhould go not only where he had before ſent them but likewiſe to thoſe Places then forbidden, which if this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition be rejected, what Wiſdom or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence ſhould there be in theſe Texts.</p>
            <p>Seing Chriſt himſelf gives us the Parable of the ten Virgins <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.1. &amp;c. whereof five were Wiſe, and five Fooliſh: may we not ſuppoſe them to be the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> and the five wiſe to repreſent the <hi>Jews</hi> they being thoſe holy Bodies that aroſe out of the Graves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27, 25. and went into the Holy City with thoſe who were to ariſe and aſcend with him to whom the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven was near: The fooliſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were to buy Oyle, their time being not yet come where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were to enter, and therefore our Saviour bids them watch againſt his ſecond coming at the end of the World at which time they were to enter.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. Whether when the <hi>Meſſias</hi> died, he ſignifying the Temple, was it not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that the Vail of the Temple ſhould be Rent from the top to the bottom, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.51. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all ſeperation now to be taken away between God and Man; between man and man alſo, as in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28. and <hi>Col.</hi> 3.11.</p>
            <pb n="232" facs="tcp:48714:124"/>
            <p n="18">XVIII. Whether was it not neceſſary, that after 3 days, he ſhould ariſe again from the Dead; and that the Graves ſhould be opened, and many holy Bodies ſhould ariſe with him out of the Grave, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 52, 33 to ſhew forth the Virtue and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with which he was endued, to draw all men after him, (as in <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.32.) they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt fruits, (as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20, 21, 22. 23. and in 1 <hi>James</hi> 18. and <hi>Rome.</hi> 14.4) that had finiſed their Revolution?</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. Whether Holy Writ in <hi>Acts</hi> 1.3. Signifying that Chriſt continued 40 days, Walking on the Earth, before he aſcended, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 1.9. may we not conclude, that it is ſignified to us, that in 40 Years, the whole Temple ſhould be deſtroyed? he having in fourty dayes finiſhed the Work he came to do, as in <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.4. Fourty being the fourt out-workings of Male and Female, Wherein all do compleat the final fulfilling of their own Revolutions? which I wiſh to all men as well as to my own ſelf.</p>

            <head>
               <hi>Here follows An Exact from the laſt Words of the Philoſopher</hi> Socrates, <hi>concerning</hi> The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of SOULS.</head>
            <p>WHen <hi>Socrates</hi> had thus ſpoken, <hi>Cebes</hi> began and ſaid, All is right what thou haſt ſpoken, O <hi>Socrates:</hi> But as for the Soul; Men are generally very apt to disbelieve that Souls after their departure, do exiſt any where, but think that at the ſame time that a Man Dies, his Soul periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and that it is no ſooner let looſe from the Body, but it is annihilated, and like a Wind or Smoak, vaniſheth, and diſappears. But if it be ſo that the Soul Exiſts ſome where gathered up into her ſelf, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from thoſe Evils and Miſchiefs thou haſt mentioned, then may we have a great and good hope, O <hi>Socrates,</hi> that all you have diſcourſt is true. Yet perhaps there will be need of ſtrong perſwaſion and Belief, to make people think, that the Soul after its departure doth ſtill exiſt, and hath ſome power and underſtanding.</p>
            <pb n="234" facs="tcp:48714:125"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Soc.</hi> True O <hi>Cebes.</hi> But what thinkeſt thou if we ſhould diſcourſe a little about it, whether it be propable that it is ſo, or not, <hi>Cebes?</hi> That would be very acceptable to me, and I ſhould with great ſatisfaction hear your Opinion concerning theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soc.</hi> I truſt no body hearing us diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of theſe things, will report of us that we ſpend the time in vain and unprofitable talk. If you think good therefore, and it may not be thought improper for us to ſearch into this Matter; let us firſt of all enquire and conſider, <hi>whether the Soul of the deceaſed do exiſt after this life or not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is an Old Proverb now comes into my mind, which ſaith, <hi>That Souls as they go from hence thither, ſo they alſo come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from thence, and return from the Dead.</hi> If this now be true that the Living pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed or come out of the Dead, then our Souls muſt have been ſomething formerly there; for had they been nothing, they could never have returned thence, and this is a ſufficient token that it is ſo, if we can prove that <hi>the Living proceed from no where elſe than from the Dead.</hi> But if this cannot be proved, we muſt produce ſome other Argument. <hi>Ceb.</hi> Very right.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soc.</hi> We may trace this, not only in Man, but if we deſire to underſtand it more
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48714:125"/>clearly in Animals alſo, and Plants, and in a Word, in every thing that is born or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated; wheether all things be not Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in ſuch a manner, as that one contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry always proceeds from the other. For inſtance, that which is <hi>Beautiful</hi> is contrary to that which is <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gly</hi> or (deformed) that which is <hi>Juſt</hi> to that which is <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt.</hi> Let us therefore conſider whether every thing that hath a contrary, doth not of neceſſity proceed from nothing elſe but from that its contrary? As when a thing grows greater, it of neceſſity grows greater out of that which is leſs. <hi>Ceb.</hi> That is very true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soc.</hi> In like manner, if any thing grows leſs is it not out of ſomething that before was greater?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ceb.</hi> Certainly ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soc.</hi> That which is weaker doth it not become ſo, out of that which was ſtronger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ceb.</hi> Yes Surely.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soc.</hi> Alſo when any thing grows worſe, is it not out of ſomething that was better; if juſt is not out of unjuſt? <hi>Ceb.</hi> Plainly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soc.</hi> Wherefore it appears that it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens thus to all thing, <hi>Viz.</hi> That one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſtill proceeds from the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ceb.</hi> It does ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soc.</hi> Again is there not alſo ſome ſuch like thing, between both theſe contrary Beings, by means whereof the one is Born
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48714:126"/>or proceeds from the other? As betwixt Great and Little there is encreaſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and of the one we ſay, that it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth, and of the other, that it decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. <hi>Ceb.</hi> It is ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soc.</hi> And is not the caſe the ſame in <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> and joyning, or <hi>mingling,</hi> and when any thing <hi>grows cold</hi> or <hi>warm?</hi> Yet ſo, as that every thing comes forth from its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and that there happens a birth out of one contrary into the other, out of this into that, and again out of that into this? <hi>Ceb.</hi> There does ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soc.</hi> Now then is there no contrary that anſwers to the word <hi>to Live,</hi> as to the word to watch, or <hi>be awake,</hi> belongs that of <hi>Slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,</hi> as the contrary to being awake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ceb.</hi> Ay certainly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soc.</hi> What is then the contrary or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit of <hi>to Live? Ceb.</hi> Why <hi>to Dye</hi> or <hi>to be Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>So.</hi> Do not theſe therefore proceed from each other, ſeing that they are contrary or oppoſite to one another. And ſeing theſe be two things, are there not two Births be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them both? <hi>Ceb.</hi> I conceive ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soc.</hi> Now from theſe Primitive Words do proceed Derivative, and Analogous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations: I ſhall give you the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of one of theſe, and do you give me the ſame of the other. I ſay then, that to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48714:126"/>
               <hi>sleep,</hi> and to <hi>be awake</hi> are contrary to one another, and that out of <hi>waking</hi> comes <hi>ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and again out of <hi>ſleeping, waking,</hi> and that between both theſe, to <hi>ſlumber,</hi> and <hi>awake;</hi> are ſet as intervening Births. Are you ſatisfied or not. <hi>Ceb.</hi> You have fully ſatisfied me. <hi>Soc.</hi> Do you the ſame then of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi> Doſt not thou ſay that theſe are contrary? <hi>Ceb.</hi> Ay verily. <hi>Soc.</hi> and that the one is born out of the other? <hi>Ceb.</hi> Even ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soc.</hi> What grows or proceeds then from the Living? <hi>Ceb.</hi> The <hi>Dying,</hi> or that which <hi>is Dead. Soc.</hi> And that out of that which <hi>is Dead? Ceb.</hi> Thence of neceſſity the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving muſt proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soc.</hi> Well then, the Living proceed from the Dead. <hi>Ceb.</hi> That is evident. <hi>Soc.</hi> And if ſo, our departed Souls are ſome where. <hi>Ceb.</hi> It ſhould ſeem ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soc.</hi> And is not one of theſe Births ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Dying? <hi>Ceb.</hi> it is ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soc.</hi> What ſhall we ſay then of the other contrary, ſhall Nature be lame (or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective) in this point only, or muſt we grant ſomething that is contrary to <hi>being Dead? Ceb.</hi> Surely we muſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soc.</hi> And pray what is that? <hi>Ceb. To become alive</hi> again. <hi>Soc.</hi> If this be ſo, there muſt of neceſſity be a return from the <hi>Dead,</hi> to life again. <hi>Ceb.</hi> There muſt ſo. <hi>See,</hi>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:48714:127"/>It appears then from this Argument (or Reaſon) that the Living proceed from the Dead, as well as the Dead come of the Living. And if this be true, we may with ſufficient ground Conjecture from hence, that the Souls of the Deceaſed muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be ſomewhere, from whence they return. <hi>Ceb.</hi> It appears plainly to me, O <hi>Socrates,</hi> that this muſt follow from what hath been above grantetd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soc.</hi> Conſider, dear <hi>Cebes,</hi> that what we have before granted, was not without good ground, for except the one did continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow upon the neck of the other, and ſo went round, as in a Circle; but that all things did in a ſtraight line tend to their contraries, without returning thence again, then muſt all things finally terminate in one form and quality, and Generation muſt ceaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ceb.</hi> What do you ſay <hi>Socrates?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soc.</hi> What I ſay is ſomewhat difficult to be underſtood; as for inſtance, if one ſhould ſay that men fall aſleep, but never wake again out of that ſleep, then all things would come to that (one contrary) ſo that what is ſtoried of <hi>Endymcon,</hi> would be no longer a ridiculous Fable, and that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appeared afterwards: ſeeing that all muſt at laſt in like manner fall aſleep, and continue ſo.</p>
            <pb n="239" facs="tcp:48714:127"/>
            <p>And if all things ſhould be mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and never more be divided or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, that of <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time or other ſuddenly befall us, who held that all things ſhould once be hurled into confuſion. In like manner, Dear <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes,</hi> if this be the caſe, that whatſoever hath received life muſt dye, and what is once dead continues ſo, without ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to life again, then of neceſſity it muſt at laſt come to this, that all things be dead, and that no living thing be left: for if any thing proceeds out of any thing that is living, and that living thing Dies, what then ſhall hinder, but that all muſt be ſwallowed up by Death at laſt? <hi>Ceb.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing verily, for your words, <hi>O Socrates,</hi> ſeem very true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soc.</hi> And ſuch indeed they appear like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to me O <hi>Cebes;</hi> neither do we pretend this as being miſtaken, but it is in very deed ſo, as Springing up from a Reſuſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that out of the Dead come the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and that deceaſed Souls do ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, and that it goes well with the Good and ill with the Wicked.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Socrates</hi> proceeded in his Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Immortality of the Soul, and declared <hi>how that</hi> all Sciences we learn outwardly from others, lay hid before in
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48714:128"/>the inmoſt ground of Man, and by means of outward Objects and Applications, were only excited (or awakened) in us, and brought to our memories.</p>
